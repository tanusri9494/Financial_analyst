### Sweden’s leading platform for savings  and investments

### Avanza was founded in 1999 to offer online stock trading for individual investors at low prices. Low fees, a broad range of savings products, and education and support for investment decisions have since then been the basis of Avanza’s offer. Today Avanza is Sweden’s leading platform for savings and investments with over 70,000 investment opportunities. The offer also includes competitive occupational pension solutions and mortgages.

### The year in brief

### The year in brief by quarter

### CEO's statement

### CEO's statement

### By 2021 we already reached our long-term targets for 2025, which was set as recently as January 2020. We now have a market share of nearly 7%, and we  see continued strong growth potential in Sweden. Our focus is, and will remain

### indefinitely, the Swedish savings market.

### Sweden’s most satisfied savings customers  12 years in a row

### Another year of the global pandemic has passed, even though we cautiously started returning to a more normal day-to-day existence after the summer. However, many of the restrictions were reinstated at the end of the year until February, when most of them were taken away. For two years we have lived with the pandemic, or as my 21-year-old daughter recently said, “Dad, I have spent 10% of my life in a pandemic.” The pandemic has been exhausting. I really hope that we now can return to a more normal life.

### 2021 was a very successful year for Avanza. We have passed 1 million stock-owning customers and 1 million fund-owning customers, and reached a total of 1,660,100 customers. Our most important target by far is, and will always be, customer satisfaction. In December, we won the Swedish Quality Index’s award for Sweden’s most satisfied savings customers for the 12th year in a row. We are honoured and will naturally do everything we can to win again for the 13th time. In the last three years, we have welcomed 823,000 customers to Avanza. Over these three years, the stock market has gone up by 35%, 15% and 39%, respectively. We have many young customers at Avanza and a large share of our new customers have never before seen the market go down. We have several different ways to communicate with our customers, but by far the most important message is to think long-term and diversify, and to consider how fees affect your savings.

### “ Avanza is a company for everyone in Sweden who understands the importance of personal savings”

###  As of September 30, Avanza’s share of the savings market was 6.6% and our share of the net inflow on a rolling 12-month basis was 18%. This is positive, but at the same time shows that there is still a lot of room for us to grow in Sweden. We are committed to a continued focus on savings and investments and growing in Sweden. Although we have now reached a market share of 15% of Sweden’s population, we see continued strong growth ahead of us. Avanza is, and will remain, relevant to everyone in Sweden who understands the importance of saving and has a bank account.

### Updated targets with a focus on continued strong growth

### By 2021 we had already met all of the financial targets for 2025 that were announced in early 2020. Therefore we have raised our ambition and updated the targets. We are now aiming for a 10% share of the Sweden’s savings market by the end of 2025. With regard to costs, we are transitioning to an efficiency target that also shows the scalability of the business model. This means a costs to savings ratio not exceeding 12 basis points, where the ambition is to be even lower. Costs for 2022 are estimated at between SEK 1,050 million and SEK 1,070 million. Since 2019, income has increased by close to 180% and costs by  30%, which clearly shows that we are scalable. When it comes to growth, I have Avanza’s fantastic employees to thank for their commitment to improving our offering and always putting our customers first.

### “ We shall reach a market share of 10% by the end  of 2025”

### The target is also to deliver an annual return on equity of at least 35%, which shows that we are keeping a close eye on our balance sheet as well. One key measure of how well we manage our capital is the leverage ratio. In order to be able to continue to deliver a dividend of 70% of profit in coming years, we will issue Additional Tier 1 capital in 2022.

### Savers are placing growing importance  on the user experience

### We have maintained very strong margins in recent years. This is a result of our growth and scalability, at the same time that it creates flexibility for us. For example, it allows us to reduce prices and create an even more attractive offering for further growth opportunities and customer satisfaction. In the spring, we broadened our Start offer to include funds. This means that all customers with less than SEK 50,000 in savings capital are refunded all their fund commissions. They had already been able to trade equities commission-free on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. An important goal in this is to inspire more people to start saving. We have cut the interest rate on our mortgages and have improved our margin lending to give more people the opportunity to borrow at a lower rate. We have also reduced the price of our six Auto funds by 40%.

### CEO's statement

### Rikard Josefson, CEO

### “ The user experience is becoming increasingly important”

### We work in a competitive industry. New companies are jumping into the market and we know that others are close behind. We welcome this, since it keeps us on our toes. It isn’t just a question of product and price, however. The user experience is becoming much more important as well, which is why we have launched Savings Targets, Milestones, Your Month and Right Now, so when our customers log in they are met by even more information relevant to them and their savings. Another improvement is a broader mortgage offering thanks to the addition of Landshypotek to the platform. Here our aim is to eventually become a mortgage platform, but of course we realise that it will take time.

### New regulations must be designed  to help the consumer

### Many other things happened in 2021 that in one way or another impacted Avanza. The year began with a debate on whether or not fund commissions should even exist, and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) investigated the industry. While nothing major was presented in its report before the end of the year, it did mention that the industry had largely examined itself. Several instances of fees where there were a potential conflict of interest had been made more transparent to customers. We still do not know whether or how the government will pursue this, but we are prepared to adapt. I hope, however, that any new regulations truly focus on the customer’s perspective and not cloudy transparency. If you look at other countries that have banned commissions, the situation has not gotten better, and it is doubtful whether it has become cheaper for the customer. Feel free to change regulations, but make sure to put the consumer first.

### During the year, we experienced a leak of personal information to Facebook. Our assessment is that no customers were harmed and we are fully cooperating with the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection and the Swedish FSA, which are investigating a potential breach of the General Data Protection Regulation. At this point, we still do not know whether this will lead to a fine, but we have closely re-examined all our processes to ensure that it does not happen again.

### On April 1, transfer rights improved for Sweden’s pension savers when it became cheaper to transfer savings to the company of their choice. Avanza’s highly competitive offer in terms of range of investment opportunities, user friendliness and price has encouraged more people to move their savings to us. Our calculations show that a 40-year-old who transfers SEK 500,000 to Avanza can, because we do not charge maintenance fees or fixed account fees, receive as much as SEK 1 million more in retirement at age 65. The government has now drafted a bill to expand transfer rights for unit-linked insurance policies signed also before 2007. The revisions are proposed take effect on 1 July 2022. While we are seeing increased transfer flows to Avanza, information campaigns and a simpler transfer process are still needed to get more people to take the step.

###  CEO's statement

### “ Transferring a pension  to Avanza could mean SEK 1 million more in  retirement”

### In the area of sustainability, much is happening with respect to regulations. We have both the Disclosure Regulation and the Taxonomy to now take into account. Plenty of time and energy are being spent around Europe on these issues, but there is still much left to be desired when it comes to clarity. We are well aware that the quality of our own reporting will have to improve as the regulations gradually change over time. The goal of regulators with this year’s reporting is that companies get started. Sustainability is important not only for the planet, but also at a company level to remain attractive as an employer, partner, investment and in customer relationships. From a customer perspective, we are concentrating on making it easier to find sustainable investment choices and to increase the share of savings capital held by women.

### Increased uncertainty leading up to 2022, but we are only just beginning our journey

### Looking ahead, there is a feverish debate right now whether global inflation is transitory or whether it will stick around. I believe we are headed towards a period of higher inflation. The combination with low interest rates we haven’t seen before. My opinion is therefore that we will see rising interest rates in the coming years. My concern with higher rates is that many people do not remember, or have never experienced, mortgage rates above 2%. We are facing a scenario we have not experienced and all we can do is to work closely with our customers. The positive thing is that the stock market over time has always been the most lucrative investment alternative. Households also have a lot of money and there are many companies that are doing well. Good prospects for investments and consumption are positive indicators for the market going forward.

### Lastly, I would like to thank all our customers and shareholders for what, in spite of everything, was a fantastic 2021. However, I remain convinced that Avanza is just in the beginning its journey. I am also proud to be working every day with the industry’s best employees to make Avanza a better company. The engagement I have seen during these difficult times leaves me speechless.

### We are ready for the next step!

### Stockholm in February 2022

### Rikard Josefson, CEO

About Avanza This is Avanza We don’t see the world as it is, but as it should be. A better future for more of us,  through the right opportunities for savings and investments, is what drives us. Customer focus is the basis of our offering

### Our business is built on a strong customer focus with a worldclass user experience and customer service. We believe our offer will stand the test of time. Through continuous innovation and product development as well as a focus on what’s best for the customer, we build trust and generate growth. Our vision is to create a better future for millions of people, where the strategy is a cheaper, better and simpler offer.

### Product development and education  to create customer value

### We want to engage people and help them understand savings through education, information and simple decision-making support. We also want to encourage and inspire sustainable savings. Education is offered through several channels. We are convinced that with the right tools our customers can make the best investment decisions themselves, so we don’t offer advice. We do not recommend specific products or services, either. They are presented objectively with both pros and cons. Another important factor to make financially sustainable investment decisions is transparency, where the price and fee model are clearly shown and where it is easy to understand each product. We want to create the best tool for our customers to successfully manage their finances, and Avanza to be the obvious choice to save sustainably.

### Since the start, Avanza has strived to democratise savings. We want to drive development in the industry and focus on the impact of fees on savings as well as challenge established structures that don’t benefit savers. We offer customers the opportunity to invest in a wide range of Swedish and foreign securities and in savings accounts, with no fixed fees and low brokerage fees. Our large fund offering includes 17 funds with very low fees from our own fund company. Competitive occupational pension solutions and mortgages are available as well.

### The end result is a promise to our customers that they will have more money left in their own pockets than with any other bank or pension company.

### We mainly target individual investors in Sweden, but have also services for professional investors and corporate customers, such as entrepreneurs, asset managers and those who want an occupational pension. For more information, see page 126.

### The Swedish savings and mortgage market

### Never before has interest in saving and investing been as high as it is today. 20 per cent of Sweden’s population saves in stocks and 80 per cent in funds. Our society is also demanding to a growing extent that everyone have personal savings.

### The Swedish savings market

### The portions of the Swedish savings market in which Avanza is active amounted to just over SEK 11,200 billion as of 30 September 2021. Households’ net inflow to the savings market was SEK 527 billion during the period October 2020 - September 2021. Pension and insurance savings, i.e. the life insurance market, is the single largest segment, accounting for nearly half of the savings market, of which individual pension and insurance savings amount to just over SEK 1,320 billion. The occupational pension market can in turn be divided into traditional life insurance and unit-linked insurance and amounts to nearly SEK 3,960 billion. ) Unit-linked insurance accounts for close to 40 per cent, of which Avanza is active in the portion outside collectively agreed occupational pensions, which is valued at nearly SEK 890 billion ) .

### Over 30 per cent of the savings market consists of direct investments in funds and equities, but occupational pension savings and individual pension savings are also largely comprised of fund and equity investments. This means that 80 per cent of the Swedish savings market is comprised of savings in equities. 1)

### An estimated 80 per cent of the Swedish population saves in funds, either directly or indirectly through their pension savings. The Swedish fund market is characterised by low prices from an international perspective and historically high returns. The average annual fee for an equity fund in Sweden was 1.01 per cent in 2020. ) This compares to the volume-weighted average fee that Avanza’s customers pay for equity funds of 0.69 and 0.70 per cent for 2020 and 2021.

###  The share of the Swedish population that owns stocks has grown in the last five years and was 20 per cent in 2020. Interest in the market is rising among women. In 2020, share ownership tripled among women, though six out of ten shareholders are still men. Young people account for a growing share of equity ownership, a trend that goes back ten years. )

### The Swedish savings and insurance market is dominated by the largest banks and major pension companies. There are also a number of smaller players.

### Avanza’s position in the savings market

### Avanza’s share of the Swedish savings market as of 30 September 2021 was 6.6 per cent, while the share of the total net inflow to the market in the latest twelve-month period was 18 per cent. 1) The Swedish savings market

### 0

### 1) Divided into traditional life (60%) and unit-linked insurance (40%).

### Avanza’s 1,660,100 customers correspond to a market share of 15 per cent of Sweden’s population. Avanza’s share is strongest in urban areas and among young people aged 20–39. For example, in the Stockholm area and among men it exceeds 40 per cent in the age categories 20–29 and 30–39. 4) Avanza’s share of the Swedish population

### Market, opportunities and risks

### Savings capital on Avanza’s platform amounted to SEK 810 billion at year end, corresponding to a growth of 42 per cent in 2021. SEK 90 billion related to net inflow.

### Fund capital on the platform was SEK 225 billion with a net inflow of SEK 33 billion. This gives Avanza a market share of new fund savings of 19.5 per cent 4) . Of the fund capital, just over 29 per cent was invested in Avanza’s own funds, corresponding to a growth of 2.1 percentage points in 2021. During the year, Avanza Funds’ share of the net fund inflow was 8 per cent, compared to its total market share of 1.2 per cent of the fund capital in the Swedish savings market.

### Fund capital with Avanza

### In the life insurance market, Avanza’s share of the premium inflow for the twelve-month period was 12.3 per cent. This makes Avanza the leader in premium inflow in the competitive pension and life insurance market, including both occupational pensions and endowment insurance. Occupational pension capital invested with Avanza totalled SEK 48 billion at year end, corresponding to growth of 39 per cent for the year. The market share of the premium inflow to non-collectively agreed occupational pensions was 7.7 per cent for the twelve-month period. This makes Avanza one of the fastest growing occupational pension companies in the Swedish market. )

### Development in occupational pension capital with Avanza

### In equity trading, Avanza in 2021 was the largest Swedish player on Nasdaq Stockholm including First North in terms of both number of transactions and turnover. Of the approximately 2 million equity investors in Sweden, 1 million were Avanza customers as of 31 December.

### Market shares in stock trading among Swedish firms 2021

### The Swedish mortgage market

### Mortgage lending to Swedish households as of 30 September 2021 amounts to just over SEK 3,820 billion. The market is dominated by the four major banks, but competition from new mortgage providers has grown in recent years. )

### Average gross margins on mortgage loans have fallen due to the growing competition. However, for the last twelve-month period margins averaged 1.46, which compares to 1.35 in per cent in the corresponding period last year. )

### Avanza’s position in the mortgage market

### Avanza has since 2013 offered mortgages on a small scale to Private Banking customers, who are required to have at least SEK 3 million in total savings and a maximum loan to value ratio of 50 per cent. Only a limited share of deposits is used for lending. Since 2017, Avanza also has a broader external mortgage offer where it distributes other lenders’ products via Avanza’s platform. To date, Avanza offers mortgages from two lenders. To be more comprehensive, the offer has to be expanded to include loan to value ratios of up to 85 per cent and new loans for tenant-owned apartments.

### Total mortgage volume amounted to SEK 30 billion at year end, of which SEK 10 billion related to internally financed lending. This means a share of the mortgage market of 0.7 per cent. The market share of the net change is higher at 2.9 per cent on an annual basis. 2)

### Opportunities in the savings market

### The financial market is constantly evolving. Factors such as greater individual responsibility and growing interest in saving among the population, coupled with accelerating technological development, are placing high demands on the entire financial market. Avanza is agile with a scalable business model welladapted to this shift.

### Although Avanza already has a high market share among the stock-investing portion of the population, there is still good growth potential, especially among Sweden’s fund owners. Everyone in Sweden with a bank account and who understands the importance of personal savings is a potential Avanza customer. For more information, see page 14.

### There are eight main trends that drive the market development.

### 1. Greater responsibility for personal finances For some time, we have been moving toward a society where individuals are expected to take greater responsibility for their financial well-being. Most people need a buffer for unexpected events, a home purchase and retirement.

### We also have a gap between men and women  when it comes to savings. The development of a stronger savings culture among women is important not only for the individual women but for society as a whole, since women today have both lower lifetime incomes and live longer than men. Euroclear’s report on equity ownership in Sweden shows a strong positive trend of the average holding among women. This growing interest among women is also evident at Avanza.

### Share of female equity ownership at Avanza is increasing year after year

### With occupational pensions and public pensions, most pensioners will receive about 60 per cent of their salary in retirement. Most women can expect a lower pension than that. Maintaining a standard of living in retirement therefore requires private pension savings. The need is high and is expected to remain that way, as long as the pension system is designed according to the current model and the gender wage gap persists.

###  Another example which shows the importance of personal savings is the structure of the housing market, where prices have been rising for years. This is mainly due to low interest rates and insufficient new construction, at the same time that demand has been strong. Approximately 60 per cent of the housing stock in Sweden currently consists of tenant-owned apartments, and it is mainly the Stockholm region that is driving this trend. At the same time that home prices have risen, household debt has as well. To mitigate the risks that come with a high level of debt in society, the Swedish FSA has taken a number of measures, including introducing a mortgage ceiling. While the ceiling is considered to have had a positive effect on debt levels, it has also contributed to higher thresholds in the housing market. All in all, this means that households that want to buy a home have to save more to afford the cash down payment. This is especially true to first-time buyers, and the situation is not expected to change.

### 2. Digitisation creates new conditions

### The Swedish financial market is highly digital and most customers currently manage their banking and savings digitally. In addition, the full-service offerings of the major banks are being picked apart by niche players that focus on a single product or service and can maintain lower costs and prices. Taken together, the increasing digitisation is leading to a more mobile financial market with a greater selection and more price pressure on products and services.

### On an international level, more firms, with different product ranges, are expanding and competing in the savings market. Payment apps such as PayPal and Cash App and neobanks such as Revolut have added trading in equities and crypto- assets. Crypto specialists such as Coinbase and BlockFi are launching debit cards, brokers such as Robinhood are launching debit cards and current accounts, and robo-advisors such as Wealthfront are introducing crypto exposure on their platforms, as well as debit cards and current accounts.

### So-called Payment For Order Flow (PFOF), where a brokerage firm receives payment from a third party for directing customer orders to them, has also become more common internationally. With this business model, the brokerage firm does not charge a commission; instead they are paid for the order flow from a third party. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has stated that this business model, in most cases and especially when the service is marketed free of charge, is incompatible with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID2), since PFOF creates a conflict of interest between the brokerage firm and its customers and could affect the spread between bid and offer prices, thereby giving the customer a worse price and hidden indirect cost.

### Market, opportunities and risks

### While digitisation has increased competition in the market, the major banks in Sweden continue to dominate in most sectors. But with digitisation as an engine, this is likely to change as customers seek out the best price and user experience from different providers.

### In addition to strong competition and simpler, less expensive products, digitisation has paved the way for new types of products on the financial market. One example is crypto-assets, where bitcoin and ether are the most widely talked about.

### The EU Commission has been working for some time to strengthen the digitisation of financial products. In autumn 2020, a Digital Finance Strategy was presented in the EU. The strategy includes a review of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the launch of the next step in Open Banking, called Open Finance. New rules have been proposed for the market in crypto-assets (MiCA) as well as a pilot programme where use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) can be tested. The hope is that it will be even easier for consumers to compare different financial products and switch to new providers. Another aim is to ensure that EU rules are adapted to a more digitised financial market. The strategy also proposes future regulations to strengthen cyber security.

### Work is now underway within the EU to negotiate and implement the initiatives laid out in the strategy. Our view is that this will strengthen the conditions for further digitisation to the benefit of customers.

### 3. Increased transparency and stronger consumer protection

### Not only have digitisation and transparency made customers more price conscious, but regulations have contributed as well, including MiFID2 and the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD), which entered into force in 2018. This has clarified the reporting rules on the fees customers have to pay. In addition, the rules on conflicts of interest have been streamlined to prevent advisory fees and strengthen the concept of independent advice. This gradually increases the need for and range of products where the saver can find support to make their own investment decisions without commission-driven advice.

### An extensive review of these rules has been launched and the EU Commission has laid out a strategy to strengthen nonprofessional investors, e.g. by simplifying participation in the securities market.

### 4. A strong and growing capital market

### Work is underway within the EU to strengthen the European capital markets through the Capital Markets Union (CMU). The CMU consists of an umbrella of measures to provide small and medium-sized businesses greater access to capital and make it easier for European consumers to save and invest for the long term. Within the framework of the CMU, proposals will be presented to further promote the savings market. Although the Swedish capital market has come further than many others in Europe, the proposals presented within the framework of the CMU are also expected to have a positive effect for Sweden. Not least because it will be easier for capital to flow between EU member states when regulations are harmonised and clarified.

### 5. A more mobile occupational pension market Most of the occupational pension capital outside the major collective agreements in Sweden is currently invested through insurance companies, which charge an annual volume-based fee of around 0.6 per cent of invested capital. This means that Sweden’s pension savers pay several billion SEK in unn ecessary annual fees. Money that could instead contribute to a better pension at a time when responsibility for pension savings increasingly rests with the individual.

### Current pension transfer rights are constrained by high fees and overly complex, time-consuming administration for the individual. The government has for several years tried to simplify the transfer market in Sweden. In April 2021, a new law took effect that limits the fees charged on occupational pension transfers and allows savers to transfer unit-linked insurance policies to less expensive alternatives. The maximum cost is approximately SEK 600, compared to the previous percentage fee on total capital, which can be very expensive. Transfer rights so far cover only policies signed after 2007. Work is underway at the Government Offices, however, to give the majority of policyholders who today are not allowed to repurchase or transfer their individual unit-linked insurance the opportunity to switch providers. As proposed, the new rules will take effect on 1 July 2022.

### At the same time, the transfer process remains complicated and time consuming and more work is needed to create a well-functioning occupational pension market, which Avanza is pushing for.

### 6. Wealth transfers across generations

### Within a few years, several countries, including Sweden, will see a transfer of assets from older to younger generations. The big generation born in the 1940s and 50s has built up tremendous wealth and today owns a major part of the savings capital. This will affect many younger people in a positive way, and in the future impact the capital markets as well.

### 7. The financial industry’s role in achieving the Sustainable

### Development Goals

### The financial industry plays a key role if we are going to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The EU has therefore drafted an action plan to steer capital flows to sustainable businesses. The regulation on sustainability-related disclosures, which took effect on 10 March 2021, is part of this action plan and will force companies in the financial sector, in a standardised way, to disclose how they are addressing sustainability issues and how sustainability risks are integrated in investment decisions and client advice. This is in addition to the EU’s Taxonomy Regulation, part of which applies as of 1 January 2022. This regulation will ensure that the financial sector applies uniform rules on which investments can be called green and sustainable. Analysing savings from a sustainability perspective will become an important economic issue when corporate profitability is affected by changing consumer behaviours, stricter regulations and tougher climate laws. This will, in all likelihood, have a long-term impact on the companies and their share prices. The effect is accentuated by the financial industry’s willingness to target capital to companies with a sustainable business model and a clear sustainability strategy.

### 8. A strong IPO market

### The strong restart to the world’s economies has also created high activity on the IPO market. In 2021, 137 companies had listed on First North, Spotlight, NGM and Nasdaq Stockholm. This compares to 2020, when the number of listings was 40 and 2019 with 37 listings. As a result, 2021 is ahead of the previous record year of 2017, which had 103 IPO’s. )

### The strong IPO market has also contributed to the growing interest in savings. Especially when well known companies such as Volvo Cars, Synsam and Kjell & Company go public.

### Risks in the savings market

### The Swedish financial market has performed strongly for some time with a high level of savings and more firms competing with lower prices. The risks to consider going forward are presented below.

### Unexpected measures from central banks For some time, central banks have been making massive asset purchases in the financial markets to guarantee liquidity. Interest rates have been kept at a low level as well. Since the financial markets have recovered after plunging in March 2020, the world’s central banks have now gradually begun to wind down their purchases. While this process has been clearly communicated, there is a risk that the market will still react negatively due to concerns surrounding the changes.

### Moreover, inflation has risen during the year and in many countries is well above the monetary policy target. The higher level of inflation is to some extent considered transitory due to the economic restart. At the same time, there are concerns in the market that inflation has risen because of more fundamental factors, which has created turbulence. We are also now nearing a point where interest rates will begin to rise. The Swedish Riksbank’s own forecast indicates that the repo rate will not be raised until the second half of 2024.

### Despite that central banks have been transparent about upcoming monetary policy adjustments, the market has reacted negatively with falling stock prices as a result, which could scare off savers and affect the mortgage market.

### An economy that fails to recover

### The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a severe blow to the global economy with shutdowns in both manufacturing and the service sector. Massive fiscal spending was introduced to mitigate the impact on growth and employment. The Swedish economy has developed well, but still has high unemployment compared to most of the EU member states. There is a risk that unemployment remains at an elevated level, reducing opportunities for savings. At the same time, the pandemic has underscored the importance of savings and a financial buffer.

###  Sweden was in good financial shape when the pandemic began and there was enough flexibility to take extensive action to support the economy. While the public finances have remained fairly good, there is a risk that international confidence in the Swedish economy could be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the Swedish financial markets. The same applies to the rest of the world, where budget deficits and government debts are now rising. Since Sweden is a small, open economy, our financial markets could be adversely affected by potential debt crises.

### Adjustments to tax levels

### Investment savings accounts have been an important reason for the high savings rate in Sweden. In part because they have made savings easier to declare on tax returns and in part because it has become cheaper in many cases to save. Any adjustment to the tax levels on investment savings accounts and endowment insurance could negatively affect savings. Just as any change in the interest deduction on loans could affect the mortgage market and savings as a whole. The same applies to the reintroduction of a property tax. While a majority of the parties in parliament have been critical of raising the tax on tax-wrapper accounts and reintroducing the property tax, there is a growing interest in parliament in reducing the interest deduction on loans.

### Market turbulence could scare off new savers A number of stock markets around the world have performed strongly in recent years and new records have been set. This, coupled with the low interest rates, has made the stock market an attractive investment alternative and has attracted many new savers. In addition, new types of assets, such as crypto-assets, have attracted many young savers.

### Now that the market turbulence has increased significantly, there is a risk that many inexperienced savers will be hit particularly hard. Some assets are extremely volatile. In the short term, it could significantly affect their personal finances; in the longer term there is the risk that they will not be willing to invest in the stock market and thereby miss out on the chance of a higher return.

### Unconscious occupational pension transfers

### The pension company AMF has been tracking occupational pension transfers for several years. Every survey has shown that a large part of those who choose to transfer their occupational pension do so without being aware. The latest survey, conducted in December 2021, showed that this applies to one third of all people. It also showed that a large part have wound up with a form of savings they actually did not want. AMF presumes that this situation often arises because the customer has been in contact with their bank or insurance company for another reason and received an offer of a lower price on a mortgage, for example, if they also transferred their occupational pension. The rules on packaging various financial products and services were tightened once the Mortgage directive took effect. This means it is no longer possible to package loans with other financial products and services. While this has had some impact, the problem remains that many people are not making conscious, rational choices for their occupational pensions.

Avanza as an investment Avanza is an investment  in growth and scalability Record-high growth continued during the year as a result of the increased interest  in savings, at the same time that the structural changes in society are placing greater responsibility on the individual for their personal finances.

### Avanza maintains the strategy of cheaper, better and simpler offers with a focus on savings and investments. We shall work closely with customers and create an engaging user experience with smart and proactive tools to help them manage their finances. Here our culture and strong customer focus are essential to our success.

### More customers and savings capital are driving income, and this creates shareholder value. In 2021, 379,800 new customers were added and the net inflow was SEK 90 billion, the highest figures in Avanza’s history.

### Avanza’s share of the net inflow to the Swedish savings market during the period October 2020 – September 2021 was 18 per cent. This compares to the total market share of 6.6 per cent as of 30 September. The new target from 2022 is a market share of 10 per cent of the Swedish savings market by the end of 2025, which has been revised upward from nearly 7 per cent. Savings capital amounted to SEK 810 billion at the end of 2021.

### Savings capital and new customers

### Market conditions affect income

### Avanza’s income is greatly affected by market conditions, customers’ trading activity, interest rates and changes in deposit and lending volumes. A strong stock market and high volatility tend to increase the willingness of customers to take on risk as well as their activity, while a more uncertain or downward market has the opposite effect. High volatility combined with uncertainty can at the same time make customers more hesitant and reduce activity. Low interest rates squeeze net interest income but create opportunities for high income from securities trading, since the stock market becomes a more attractive alternative. During periods of higher or rising market interest rates, Avanza’s net interest income increases at the same time that customer growth in stock trading may level off. The total sensitivity in Avanza’s net interest income given a change in the repo rate of 1 percentage point, all else being equal, was over SEK 450 million on an annual basis at year end. The sensitivity in the event of a reduction in savings capital due to a downturn in the stock market is difficult to assess, as income is dependent on, among other things, how customers choose to invest their capital. The Riksbank’s own forecast indicates that the repo rate will not be raised until the second half of 2024.

### Structural trends and changes that benefit  the savings market and Avanza

### The increasing degree of digitisation, the intention behind existing and future regulations, and the structural changes that are now occurring in society probably benefit Avanza more than many other firms. There are eight main trends that affect growth potential.

### 1. The need to save is growing as greater responsibility  is placed on the individual

### The increased need in recent years for individual savings to buy a home, manage unforeseen events or for retirement is an important growth factor. The ambition is that our offer will attract broader target groups: experienced and established savers as well as new ones. Availability will be enhanced through improvements to our mobile offer. We also continue to develop offers in more niche areas to meet the needs of active traders.

### A world-class user experience through a constantly improving and expanding offer also makes our existing customers more willing to transfer a larger share of their savings to Avanza.

### Important to encourage more women to save

### The growing interest in stock investing among women is positive for both the individual and society as a whole. At the same time, big differences still remain in how women and men save. During the year, Avanza increased its efforts to motivate and inspire more women to save. We regularly gather data on how women save and target them with special information campaigns.

### Our view is that Avanza should be a natural platform for all savers. We are working to give them tools to make their own well-informed financial decisions.

### Growing interest in savings

### The growing interest in savings and a broader customer base are expected to lead to higher growth in fund savings than in stock trading. This should increase the share of recurring income and reduce income volatility over time. The number of people in Sweden who invest in equities has increased in the last 10 years and is around 2 million, half of whom are customers of Avanza.

### As a result, there is still good potential to grow here as well, which customer growth and our market shares in recent years show. Brokerage income, which will always be volatile, strengthens Avanza’s earnings when market conditions are right. This is evident in the strong customer activity in the last two years.

### 2. Digitisation is creating new conditions

### Avanza’s strong brand, user experience and high customer satisfaction are important strengths as new competition enters the saving market. Cost leadership, which enables us to keep our fees low, gives us a strong starting point. Scalability and cost control are prerequisites for both customer and shareholder value. The high cost effectiveness is illustrated by a costs to savings capital ratio of 12 basis points.

### We have a wide range of over 70,000 investment opportunities. But due to increasing digitisation, the user experience is just as important as product range and price. The number of daily average active users on the platform were close to 500,000 in 2021, holidays and weekends included.

### Our customer-centric culture and modern organisation are well-suited to capitalise on the opportunities that changing market conditions will mean going forward. It is an important reason why we do not plan too far into the future. Thanks to an agile organisation with cross-functional teams, which can deliver a wide array of products and services, and a modern technological platform, which facilitates simultaneous development in all channels, we have a time-to-market that is hard to beat and innovation capabilities that attract the highest competence in the industry.

### Avanza has long been a distributor of a number of savings products from various providers and therefore is well-positioned for the many opportunities that will come with further digitisation, from both a business model perspective and a customer experience perspective. Outside collaborations will continue if they strengthen our offer and align with what our customers want. Here Avanza’s strong distribution capabilities are a big competitive advantage to attract new partners.

### 3 & 4. More transparency and stronger consumer protection

### For Avanza, the interests of customers come first. We have always focused on low prices with a long-term view and avoided commission-driven advice in favour of convenient tools on our platform to help customers save based on their personal needs. Avanza therefore is also well-positioned with respect to the rules on consumer protection and transparency on commissions and independent advice. Also, Avanza Pension is one of the few pension companies that does not pay commissions to insurance brokers. If new limits are placed on third party compensation in Sweden, there are concrete plans to take action and adapt the business model. Avanza respects clear and transparent pricing.

### Market conditions are expected to continue to put a squeeze on prices in the industry and benefit consumers, especially in fund and insurance savings. This is likely to strengthen Avanza’s position.

### 5. Strong pension offer creates good growth opportunities when transfers are simplified

### Quality of life in retirement depends to a large extent on the investment decisions made today. A big push is needed in communication and education to increase awareness in the general population. Here, Avanza’s spokespersons on savings and our

###  Avanza as an investment

### education channels in the form of blogs and podcasts play an important role. Avanza is still a relatively small player in occupational pensions, but the fastest growing.

### Avanza’s offer, without insurance-related fees, coupled with the breadth of the offer and our digital tools, is a strong competitive advantage as transfer rights for unit-linked insurance are improved. Through simple tools, we educate savers on pensions and the importance of fees, which means more money left over for them. Here the new technology and rules introduced in Open Finance will facilitate the development of more tools and services.

### There are still big opportunities to further simplify the administration of pension transfers in the industry. Avanza continues to promote these changes.

### In occupational pensions, fund savings account for over 70 per cent, which as the pension business grows is also expected to increase the share of more stable income and reduce the sensitivity to market fluctuations.

### To this point, only 7.7 per cent of our current customer base consists of occupational pension customers, which we see as further growth potential.

### 6. Wealth transfers to younger generations We have attracted a large share of younger customers in the last 10 years. While younger customers generally have fewer financial resources than older customers, which affects the relationship between customer inflow and growth in savings capital and income here and now, there is great potential if we continue to create attractive offers and good reasons for them to stay with Avanza. This is especially true when it comes to wealth transfers from older to younger generations. Avanza will probably be positively affected by this. The churn in recent years has been under 2 per cent, which shows that very few customers are leaving us.

### Age distribution Sweden’s population and Avanza’s customers

### In addition, there is great potential in young savers who have learned about and become interested in the savings market at an early age. They have good opportunities to build their savings over time.

### Avanza as an investment

### Age distribution and savings capital by age

### 7. We contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals  by encouraging sustainable choices

### Since the beginning, Avanza has sought to lower prices and educate the public about savings and investments. The user experience and our information and education programmes are important puzzle pieces as interest in and demand for sustainable investments grows. This also helps us attract a broader group of savers.

### The new regulations which enter into force in the coming years will set the standard for disclosure of sustainability information, which in turn will improve the tools and the information on Avanza’s platform.

### 8. A strong IPO climate

### Our large customer base provides an attractive platform for cost-effective diversification, at the same time that our customers gain access to investment opportunities that otherwise are available only to institutions and a select few individuals. Avanza is a party to the most transactions on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

### Focus of investor meetings in 2021

### In 2021, we had over 160 meetings with investors, the vast majority of which were held digitally. The following topics were mainly discussed.

### Q Avanza’s growth potential in Sweden and question of when we will expand abroad. Although we have had fantastic growth in recent years, we still see great potential in the Swedish savings market, especially our share of savings capital. It is not inconceivable that we reach a point where we feel it is the right time to expand outside Sweden, Avanza is a high-growth company, but at the same time we cannot downplay the importance of a strong, recognised brand to attract customers and their savings. Regulatory contexts and tax structures also differ, as do savings cultures. Up to now, our belief is that it is better to concentrate our resources on Sweden.

### Q Our marketing strategy and whether it would be profitable to spend more. Here our strategy is to create customer value and a better user experience with products that market them-selves. For more information, see from page 28. The customer acquisition cost in 2021 was SEK 96 (102) ) .

### Q What we can do to keep customer activity high. Customer activity is a reflection of the general market conditions and volatility and turnover on the stock market. Our belief is that the best thing we can do for our customers is to develop good tools and to educate and inform them about healthy and longterm savings. Our most important long-term goal by far is customer satisfaction and maintaining our strong customer focus and culture. That’s how we attract customers and make them good savers. In the long term, this contributes to activity and creates shareholder value.

### Q The risk that commissions will be squeezed given what is happening in the U.S. market. Commissions in Sweden are at such levels that there are other factors our customers value, i.e. user experience, information and tools. At the same time, the rules differ in the US and Europe. Selling order flows, which is done by many firms that do not charge commissions, conflicts with a number of key consumer protections in the MiFID2 directive such as best execution, conflicts of interest and incentives. As a result, payment for order flow in most cases probably is not compatible with the directive.

### Q Fund commissions and a possible ban on distribution compensation, and an eventual platform fee. There currently aren’t any proposals to ban commissions, and it wouldn’t happen overnight. If a ban eventually were introduced, we have concrete proposals to modify our business model. It has to be remembered at the same time that Sweden has a wellfunctioning model when it comes to distribution fees, and low fund fees from an international perspective. A platform fee would hurt customers who mainly invest in low-fee funds.

### Q The mortgage offer and more partners. Our mortgage offer is an important piece of the puzzle as we grow. The aim is that this growth area will eventually also create more stable income. We would prefer to see a broader mortgage platform with more competition. We have to expand our offer partly for higher loan to value ratios to better accommodate our young customers and add new loans.

### Q Development regarding pension transfers. We are seeing increased interest in transferring occupational pensions to Avanza since April, but a transfer still takes far too long. With respect to net occupational pension flows during the year, a growing share was accounted for by transfers. We also have a large number of ongoing transfers. Greater public awareness is still needed in the pension area, however, to inform savers of what fees do to their capital.

### Q Whether an operating margin of 74 per cent is consistent with the customer promise or whether price cuts wouldn’t create additional growth. While Avanza’s business model is built on scale and a high operating margin, this does not mean that the customer promise – more to you and less for the bank – does not apply. The customer promise comprises both low price and good decision support. We cut a number of prices during the year, at the same time that we have developed and improved our decision support and analysis tools on the platform. Prices have to be cut where they do the most good, both for customers and for Avanza’s further growth. We are constantly looking at how we can develop and improve our offering.

### What does sustainable mean to you?

###  In conversations and interviews we have noticed that what one person means by sustainable doesn’t necessarily apply to others. Some people may feel most strongly about environmental issues, others about corporate governance and others still may simply want to avoid investing in certain industries. We have therefore created the Sustainability Label, which makes it easy to save in whatever you think is sustainable.

### Stakeholder dialogue

### Our success requires listening  to customers

### The longevity of Avanza’s business is tied to our ability to deliver what our stakeholders want. Listening to our customers and meeting their needs improves our

### offer and gives us new perspective.

### Key focus areas are identified in dialogue  with our stakeholders

### Avanza’s most important stakeholders from a business standpoint are customers, employees and owners. In addition, there are partners, suppliers, media, authorities and legislators. By maintaining an open dialogue, we find out what is important to them. The areas that customers, employees and owners all stress are transparency, innovation, user experience and availability, and IT security – but most importantly our strong customer focus. There are also other areas more specific to each stakeholder group, which is illustrated on the next page. These are important parts of our strategy and development, and encompasses the entire organisation without limitations.

### A close dialogue has helped us to have the most satisfied savings customers for twelve consecutive years We dialogue with our customers by phone and email, through social media, personal meetings and surveys.

### We regularly send out customer surveys, both general in nature and for more specific products, tools and functions. Prior to new launches, several steps are taken. We conduct customer interviews and user testing and also go back to look at years of feedback on old pages and functions. In addition, we review quantitative data on how customers interact with the page. In the next phase of major changes, we release a beta version to a small number of customers to get feedback on the new pages in a real environment and make additional adjustments. Customers can choose themselves whether they want to test out the new functions.

### Our customers are highly engaged, which also means that we get feedback through tens of thousands of messages to our customer service, Twitter comments and app reviews. On the site we also have a tool called “Feedback Buddy,” where customers can leave comments directly to the development teams.

### Each year we have surveys on the range of products and services we offer, including an open question on what would make Avanza perfect. In 2021, three such surveys were conducted.

### After a call to customer service, we send out a digital survey to make sure we have provided the best possible service. This allows us to continuously measure customer satisfaction, ensure that we receive feedback and get back to customers if needed.

### While many of us receive feedback from customers, we have a dedicated employee in customer service who coordinates and continuously passes on customers’ views and suggestions to product teams and management. Improvements are made to our offers on a weekly basis through updates on the site and in apps and infrastructure largely based on responses from customers and changes in user preferences.

### All this, together with our market analysis, is important to improving the offer.

### An open work environment and creative dialogue encourage employee engagement

### Our employees are driven by our vision and by creating change. At the same time, they want to feel that they are developing professionally and having fun. An open work environment is essential to capitalise on ideas and create engagement, which increases our innovative capacity.

### We track how employees feel about the work environment through anonymous and quick pulse surveys. They are conducted three times a year and focus on the work environment, leadership and engagement and have a response frequency of around 90 per cent. The surveys identify what is working and what is not, and whether we are improving over time. Employees are also encouraged to discuss what they feel needs to improve or change to make them happier and more engaged. The pulse surveys also gauge employees’ motivation and how they feel about coming to work. The results are followed up in workshops within each department.

### Performance reviews conducted over the course of the year between employees and their managers provide information on needs, opinions and desires, and are an opportunity to monitor and discuss each person’s development and performance. Well-defined goals strengthen motivation.

### We also have a process to monitor new employees during their first three months to ensure that their expectations regarding leadership, culture and the work they are doing have been met during this initial period.

### When an employee leaves the company, we conduct an exit interview. This includes an anonymous survey to identify signals and information on why employees decide to leave and why we may not have succeeded in meeting their expectations. This is an important way to get an honest opinion on Avanza as an employer, our leadership and whether the individual felt they could impact their work situation. The conversations are held by HR, which compiles a semiannual report for management on suggested improvements.

### Besides the day-to-day communication, there are a number of ways we strengthen this dialogue and ensure that our employees are heard. We hold monthly roundtable lunches where employees from different departments meet with the CEO and other senior executives to discuss suggestions and ideas, ask questions and voice opinions. Monthly meetings bring the whole company together to present what is going on in the business and provide an opportunity to ask questions directly to Group Management and the CEO. During the pandemic, they have been held virtually .

### Our open office concept creates a closeness which, along with an unpretentious culture, is designed to foster internal dialogue.

### Transparency to create understanding and give a fair view of Avanza to our owners

### We regularly communicate with owners and potential investors face-to-face and by email and phone. In addition to our financial reports and press releases, we publish monthly statistics and have historical financial data from 2001.

### In 2021, we held over 160 meetings with investors, most of which were held digitally. In addition, Avanza took part in several digital roadshows and investment seminars. We dialogue regularly with the analysts that follow Avanza.

### Stakeholder dialogue

###  Owners and investors want transparency and availability to understand the decisions that we make, our financial reporting, as well as the industry as a whole. We strive to be as transparent and available as possible to give investors an accurate picture of Avanza. Through this dialogue and communication, and by listening to opinions, we also try to build trust among owners and analysts. Reporting and information disclosures will reflect our progress in meeting targets and priorities while facilitating thorough analysis and well-informed investment decisions.

### Vision, business model and strategy

### Our vision is to create a better future for millions of people

### We want to give our customers good tools and encourage and inspire them to save sustainably. Through continuous innovation, with a focus on what’s best for the customer, we build trust and generate growth. Our aim is to create the best tool for our customers to successfully manage their finances.

### A business model built on customer  focus and scale

### The business model is built on scalability. Strong customer growth, combined with the market’s lowest costs to savings capital ratio, creates long-term growth in income and facilitates further development.

### The inflow of savings capital is driven by new and existing customers, which places great importance on customer satisfaction. Throughout Avanza, there is a very strong focus on doing what’s best for our customers. Satisfied customers are good ambassadors, talk about us, recommend us to others and want to stay with us.

### The income to savings capital ratio is a result of our pricing strategy to make the offer more attractive. It is also due to market trends, including changing customer behaviours, the savings mix, market conditions, trading activity, and not least the interest rate environment. Interest rates were raised in 2020; at the same time, customer growth and activity have been record high since then, and consequently revenues have grown.

### Income is mainly transaction-based even though the share of fund commissions has grown significantly in recent years, in line with Avanza’s aim to reduce income volatility.

### To deliver shareholder value and at the same time meet our promise to customers, cost effectiveness is critical. Our business is built on scale, and our success in this respect is illustrated by the declining costs to savings capital ratio.

### Timeless business model built on scale

### Our strategy is to do it cheaper, better  and simpler

### We follow a strategy to continuously improve our offering to be cheaper, better and simpler. We concentrate on three areas to achieve this: Customer Focus och Innovation, Scalability & Efficiency, as well as Sustainability.

### The key to Avanza’s strategy and success is our employees. Our corporate culture draws its energy from a willingness to create change. The culture is important if employees are going to thrive, feel engaged and develop. We place great importance on maintaining a strong culture where everyone is encouraged to think in new ways, challenge and come up with new ideas. It is also characterised by collaboration and humility.

### We are convinced that satisfied customers, along with engaged employees who enjoy going to work, create long-term value and, as a result, satisfied shareholders.

### Customer focus

### Avanza’s business is built on a strong customer focus and high service level. Doing what’s best for our customers is central to everything we do. We want to offer a world-class user experience with a broad range of products and services. We believe our customers can make the best decisions and do not offer investment advice. Instead we provide information, education and decision-making tools to help them make the right investments.

### Innovation, Scalability & Efficiency

### Customer focus and an attention to their needs is integral to our product development. We see all employees as potential product developers. Development is delegated to autonomous teams with cross-functional competencies and expertise in their areas. This, coupled with a modern technological platform, facilitates a highly competitive innovation rate and simultaneous development in all our channels. By concentrating our business and development on areas where we are, or can be, the best, we create the most value for our customers.

### Innovation is also important from a cost perspective. Scalability and efficiency allow us to maintain cost leadership. Continuous improvements to our systems also enable us to quickly respond to changing customer preferences. We work tirelessly to eliminate old technology that could slow development. We continuously evaluate new technology and update and modernise our systems. Our technological platform is among the industry’s most modern. The strategy is to never put ourselves in a dilemma with old systems and to continuously automate and simplify our p rocesses. By not planning too far into the future, we stay flexible and can respond to what happens around us. We update the site and apps with improvements and new functions on an ongoing basis, with at least one new release a week.

### Our systems provide stability, large capacity and economies of scale and enable us to deliver high quality.

### Sustainability

### We want Avanza to be the obvious choice for those who save sustainably. Since the start, we have worked to reduce prices, educate the public on saving and investing, and promote gender equality. The environment and social engagement have become increasingly important to sustainable development and business. Our sustainability work is focused on three areas.

### Sustainable investments

### Our ambition is to facilitate and inspire sustainable savings. An important part of making financially sustainable investment decisions is transparency, where prices and fees are clearly spelled out and where it is easy to understand each product. In our own funds, sustainability aspects are implemented according to the opt-out principle. For more information, see pages 26–27.

### Vision, business model and strategy

### Educate & Challenge

###  We want to be the obvious choice for those who want to learn more about personal finances and sustainable savings. By educating, driving opinion and challenging convention, we want to create opportunities for more people to be financially empowered and inspire them to invest more in sustainable products. Contributing to greater equality in savings is a key element in our sustainability work. Our customers have SEK 810 billion in savings capital with Avanza, and through information and inspiration we can do more to encourage sustainable choices. We want to drive development toward a sustainable financial market. For more information, see pages 26–29.

### Sustainable organisation

### We operate in an industry built on trust and shall ensure good governance and control. We work actively to increase gender equality and diversity. We also strive to create a sustainable office through a healthy work environment and by reducing our resource and energy consumption. For more information, see

### Basic supply Financial savings and investment products as well as mortgages

### Targets and outcomes — an overview Targets and outcomes

### Growth is an important element in our business model. Performance on targets is therefore primarily measured by customer satisfaction, where our employees play a key role. In early 2020, we launched new long-term targets for 2025. After the very strong growth, these targets have been revised higher. The sustainability targets have been adjusted as well.

### TARGET	PERFORMANCE ON TARGET	COMMENT

### Targets and outcomes — an overview Our sustainability targets

### We want to contribute to a better and more sustainable future for millions of people and drive the development of a sustainable financial market. We have targets to measure the effects of our sustainability work. This means creating opportunities for a better financial situation for each and everyone and encouraging more sustainable investments. We also work actively for gender equality in savings.

TARGET	COMMENT

### Agenda 2030 and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals create a framework for the entire world’s efforts to promote sustainable development. As a company, we can contribute to the goals by driving Avanza in a sustainable and responsible direction. A number of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals have inspired us when setting our own sustainability targets.

### Be seen as the leading sustainable brand and the natural choice for sustainable savings and increase the share of women to 50 per cent of new customers

### New target: Increase gender equality  in savings

### Avanza’s reputation as a company is a sign of quality and public confidence. The goal is to be the company in the financial industry with the highest reputation, which is measured once a year in  KantarSifo’s reputation index. The goal was reached for 2021.

### The number of new female customers was record high in 2021 and the share of new female  customers increased.

### We work actively to reach broader target groups and promote savings among women. Today women save less, have lower savings capital and begin to save later. We want to help change this. The share of women on Avanza’s platform is currently 37 per cent, at the same time that their share of savings capital is 27 per cent.

Targets and outcomes — an overview TARGET	COMMENT Sustainable organisation

### Organisation with  parity between women and men and become

### climate positive

### New target:

### Climate neutrality

###  We firmly believe that an organisation that champions gender equality contributes to a better corporate culture, makes Avanza more dynamic and creates a better understanding of the market and its development. The target is measured in Group Management and among managers with personnel responsibility. Read more about our work on pages 32–36.

### We shall be a climate-smart organisation that monitors our carbon footprint. Each year a climate report is prepared with the help of an independent analysis tool based on the methodology used in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). This year’s emissions amounted to 366 tonnes CO 2 e. Our aim is to improve the analysis, and this year it was improved to include additional waste and district heating. The increase in  2021 is mainly due to purchased IT equipment. For 2021 climate offsets of 366 tonnes CO 2 e were purchased.

### In 2022, Avanza will submit a letter of intent to set a Science Based Target (SBT). The concrete target for cutting emissions and the year when it will be achieved will be set at acceptance by SBT.

### Sustainability in the savings capital

### Sustainability in the  savings capital

### Avanza is a platform with a broad range of options. We do not control how customers invest, but we can make it easier and inspire them to save sustainably through a wide range of sustainable alternatives and clear information.

### Strategy to achieve sustainability  in the savings capital

### Our sustainability work when it comes to customers’ savings is focused on sustainable investments and educating them about sustainable savings. Through the media and education, we build interest and engagement. The platform, blog and Avanza Academy have sections on saving sustainably, and our podcast has interviewed a steady stream of experts on sustainability related topics. By educating and informing customers about sustainable choices, we can together play a part in steering capital to sustainable companies, which is a key factor for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement’s climate targets. ESG screening your savings is also an important economic issue given that corporate profits are increasingly being affected by climate change, stricter regulations and climate laws.

### It has to be easy to invest sustainably

### One of Avanza’s sustainability targets is to increased the share of capital in sustainable investments. For savers, it is not always easy to determine how sustainable a fund is, or how ambitiously a company is working with sustainability issues. To make it easier for them to identify sustainable investment alternatives, we have over the years developed and implemented a number of tools and made a variety of sustainability data available on the platform. These tools include the Sustainability Label, Morningstar’s Green Leaf and Globes, the Nordic Swan ecolabel and the Sustainability indicator.

### Many people find it hard to invest sustainably, at the same time that personal opinions play a role. We therefore developed the Sustainability Label, which lets customers decide what sustainability means to them personally based on four areas: Environment & Climate, Controversial Industries, Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance.

### Another example of a tool for sustainable savings is Morningstar’s Green Leaf label, which is only given to funds with holdings in companies with less exposure to fossil fuels and low carbon risk. The analysis is done by Sustainalytics at a company level.

### The Nordic Swan ecolabel, which was added to the fund list this year, is an assurance that a fund is working ambitiously with sustainability. It is the official ecolabel of the Nordic countries, and was established by the government as an unaffiliated nonprofit.

### The ESG score for funds is based on a scale of 0–100, where a lower score means a lower sustainability risk. Morningstar determines the score based on an analysis by Sustainalytics. Morningstar’s Globes are another way to find sustainable funds using a score. Based on how the holdings in the funds manage ESG risks relative to other funds in the same global category, they receive up to five globes, with five globes meaning the lowest ESG risk.

### A lot is happening in the sustainability area, not least in terms of regulation, because of which companies are getting better at sustainability reporting and the reporting is becoming more uniform. Sustainability data on the platform is constantly being improved.

### Avanza’s own funds and sustainability in their management When Avanza launches its own funds, it is to fill the gaps we see in the fund market. We also want to inspire to more sustainable investments.

### Avanza Fonder’s funds of funds promote environmental and social characteristics and have been classified according to Article 8 of the Disclosure Regulation as light green funds. Sustainability aspects are implemented primarily by including light and dark green funds, i.e. funds that meet the requirements in Article 8 or 9 of the Disclosure Regulation, and excluding firms with large sustainability risks. The funds of funds  exclude funds that invest in companies that violate international norms and conventions on the environment, human rights, labour and business ethics, such as the UN Global Compact and the OECD’s guidelines for multinational enterprises. The funds of funds also have restrictions on how much the companies in their underlying funds can generate turnover from coal. Management also includes a dialogue on the sustainability work of the underlying funds. The purpose is to influence the external managers’ sustainability work and reduce sustainability risks in the funds.

### The Avanza Zero index fund’s objective is to track the benchmark SIX30 Return Index, which screens out companies with turnover from controversial weapons and companies that violate international norms and conventions (such as the UN Global Compact) on the environment, human rights, labour and business ethics (so-called norm-based screening). Companies can be excluded if they do not take measures to address identified problems. Avanza Fonder votes at general meetings for its direct holdings where it considers it a benefit to the fund’s investors and dialogues with selected companies to better understand their sustainability related challenges and risks.

### The Avanza Sverige fund, which was launched during the year, tracks a new index that we developed together with Morningstar, the Morningstar Sweden Sustainability Select 70. It consists of up to 70 companies in various sectors with the highest sustainability rating. In this way it includes companies that according to Sustainalytics have the lowest sustainability risks in each sector.

### Management of the feeder funds Avanza Global, Avanza Emerging Markets, Avanza USA and Avanza Europa is handled collaboratively with Amundi. They are active owners who dialogue with their companies and vote at general meetings. The feeder funds replicate two types of indices: a broader index that primarily works with exclusion and a narrower SRI index with extensive sustainability work.

### The feeder fund Avanza World Tech by TIN is a collaboration with TIN Fonder. This is an actively managed equity fund focused  on global technology companies as well as companies with a sustainability orientation. The sustainability work consists of investing in companies that contribute to a better world and are trying to reach the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals with a focus on environmental technology, resource efficiency and simulation, security and personal integrity, dematerialised growth and healthcare. The opt-out principle is applied as well.

### Avanza Småbolag by Skoglund is focused on Swedish smallcaps with sustainable business models, where the sustainability shift in society is an investment theme for the fund. Another important element is to avoid companies with high sustainability risks. The master fund excludes companies based on established sustainability criteria and the master fund company is an active owner.

### Avanza Fonder AB has signed the Principles of Responsible Investments (PRI), an independent standard developed by the UN to promote sustainable investing. Six principles have been established that signatories adopt in their sustainability work. The principles cover among other things incorporating ESG criteria in investment decisions and ownership policies, reporting sustainability work and implementation of the principles. All underlying funds and the management companies that Avanza’s funds of funds invest in must also adopt the PRI.

### Reporting according to the EU Taxonomy

### On 1 January 2022, the EU’s Taxonomy regulation took effect. The regulation contains requirements to disclose the extent to which a company’s activities are associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities according to the definition in the Taxonomy. The disclosure requirements are gradually being introduced beginning with the financial year 2021. For Avanza, this means that we are reporting how large a share of the assets on our balance sheet are taxonomy eligible at a consolidated level. The table is based on the Swedish Bankers’ Association’s template.

### Share of total assets, %

Assets related to non-NFRD undertakings,13

Other assets in the insurance operations,30
Total,100

### Disclosure on investments

### Avanza’s disclosures are based on the consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September. The methodology described below is Avanza’s approach to meet and present the disclosure requirements.

### Sustainability in the savings capital

### Exposure to economic activities that are  or are not subject to the Taxonomy

### Exposure to economic activities that are subject to the Taxonomy occurs in Avanza’s case via the bank’s internally financed mortgages and the assets in the insurance operations. The assets in the insurance operations refer to the securities that Avanza Pension’s customers have invested in through an insurance product, such as endowment insurance, occupational pension insurance and private pension insurance. The policyholders decide for themselves where the insured amount is invested and makes all investment decisions. Avanza Pension does not offer advice.

### To measure how large a share of the Group’s assets is subject to the Taxonomy, the underlying companies and the funds in the insurance products were studied. As a first stage, it is estimated that insurance-related assets corresponding to 53 per cent of the consolidated balance sheet are invested in companies that are subject to Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). In the next stage, it is estimated how large a share of these assets is subject to the Taxonomy. This includes the share of the companies’ income or turnover that is derived from activities that are subject to technical screening criteria. With regard to holdings in securities funds, we have classified the fund holdings based on the funds’ underlying assets, to the extent it is practicable.

### Since non-financial companies begin reporting in accordance with the Taxonomy for the first time in the Annual report for 2021, this year’s reporting is based on assessments using currently available public data. The assessments are based on analyses and estimates made by Sustainalytics at the company level. The data will probably change significantly in coming years, mainly because the Taxonomy will be expanded with technical screening criteria for additional climate targets, but also as the underlying companies’ own taxonomy reporting will be public at that point.

### National governments, central banks and supranational  issuers as well as derivatives

### Exposure to these types of assets is not included in the above classification and is reported separately. In the exposure to national governments, central banks and supranational issuers, Avanza has included the exposure to municipalities and regions.

### Assets related to companies that are not subject to NFRD This category includes holdings in the insurance operations invested in companies that do not need to disclose sustainability information according to the NFRD. The data, just like the other data on the assets in the insurance products, is based on estimates from Sustainalytics.

### Other assets in the insurance operations

### This category includes investments in companies where we do not have any data on how large a share of the companies’ turnover or income is derived from activities subject to the Taxonomy. Investments in companies where we do not have data on the region are included as well. This also includes holdings in funds that we have not been able to analyse, as well as liquidity in funds that we have been able to analyse and in insurance-based brokerage accounts.

Our customers Sweden’s most satisfied savings  customers 12 years in a row Customer growth remained very strong in 2021. Avanza is growing mainly among customers between the ages of 19 and 30. The high user experience and our customer focus continue to generate high ratings from customers.

### A broad customer base with strong growth

### The record-high customer growth in 2020 continued in 2021. At year-end, there were 1,660,100 customers, which means 379,800 new customers during the year. The coronavirus pandemic has contributed to the strong growth, as it has made people more aware of their financial situation. At the same time, the structural changes in society are here to stay, which means greater financial responsibility is placed on the individual. The strong stock market in recent years is also a contributing factor. Avanza’s customers mainly consist of private customers. The new customers in 2021 do not differ from the customer base as a whole. The average age of new customers was 35, though the largest share of new customers was between 19 and 30. The average age as well as number of new customers in this age category are in line with previous years. The average age of all customers was 40. The breakdown between new customers who own equities and those who own funds does not differ either from a historical perspective. The share of equity owners was higher in 2020 and 2021, but this was also true in 2015 and 2016.

### The share of women among new customers increased to 41 per cent, but still only represents 37 per cent of the customer base. Avanza continues to grow strongly among customers in urban areas. The market share of Sweden’s population is 15 per cent. In urban areas, the share is higher, and in certain age groups significantly higher, in certain cases over 30 per cent. Few customers are leaving us; churn was 1.9 per cent.

### Avanza’s share of the Swedish population

### More than half of all customers register using the apps. In terms of orders placed, around 70 per cent are through the apps. The share of customers who only use the apps varies and exceeded 50 per cent in december.

### Customer activity during the year was high, a result of market conditions and continued volatility. The number of equity-owning customers increased by 37 per cent to just over 1 million and the number of fund customers by 33 per cent, also to just over 1 million.

### Private Banking customers account for the largest share of savings capital, and Pro customers, who are among the more active traders, account for a large share of the turnover in commission-generating securities, although that has decreased as the customer base has grown. Private Banking and Pro accounted in 2021 for 18 (20) per cent of brokerage income.

### This shows the importance of the broad customer base.

### The number of occupational pension customers, 127,200, corresponds to an increase of 18 per cent for the year. Occupational pension capital increased by 39 per cent and we see an increased interest in occupational pension transfers to Avanza since the improved transfer rights that took effect in April. However, it is still administratively cumbersome and time consuming, which is why information efforts as well as education are required.

### For more information on our customers and offering, see pages 126–129.

### We take a long-term view of our offering  with a focus on the customer

### The goal of Avanza’s offering is to get more people engaged and educate them about their personal finances and savings. We want to play the role of a savings buddy by offering information and guidance, in addition to always answering questions and explain in an easy-to-understand way.

### A majority of our customers come to us by recommendation from another customer, which is a result of our strong customer focus, but also because we launch new products in our way, by thinking innovatively. We are never done; there is always something that can be better. The savings market is constantly evolving.

### We want to guide people to better savings We want to build interest and engagement in savings through various media outlets and education. We have savings economists who speak to the entire savings market and generate media attention for savings issues. In addition, there are many of us at Avanza who contribute to the blog.

### The importance of understanding personal finance is growing. Through our free education, anyone can improve their financial well-being and build a secure future. On the site we educate and inspire through our podcast, the Avanza Blog and Avanza Play. Avanza Academy helps our customers how to think when choosing stocks, funds and other securities, and how to build various types of portfolios. There are also answers to questions on taxes and tax returns. During the year, the pod had 5 million listens and the Avanza blog 7 million unique views.

### We work actively to reach broader target groups and to promote savings among women. While interest in stocks is increasing among women, six out of ten shareholders are still men. We want to get more people interested in savings, especially women. On the topic of saving sustainably, we have a number of initiatives:

### Q ”Save sustainably” in the blog – a convenient way to find exciting and inspiring blog posts on sustainable savings

### Q ”Girls who save” – an initiative to increase gender equality and get more women to save through inspiration from other women

### Q ”Gilla din ekonomi” – a network led by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority to educate the public on financial topics

### Q Regular statistics on how women and men save to spotlight the differences that create inequalities

### Q Avanza has also released two audiobooks on personal finance, Savings School and Stock School, in c ollaboration with the publisher Storytel, which have received great  interest

### To show customers how their savings perform on a monthly basis, we launched Your Month, a follow-up to Your 2019 and Your 2020, so that customers can track their holdings for the month on different levels. An updated and improved Your 2021 was launched as well.

### The page Right Now was also added to the app to provide a daily savings update. It makes it easy to find information that is often used or viewed and stay updated on valuable insights.

### Product development to simplify and improve

### A number of improvements and simplifications were made during the year to the user experience on the site and the apps. Monthly savings have been made easier through new flows and the addition of automatic fund investments. Milestones and Savings targets were launched in the apps. Milestones show when new levels are reached and are designed to motivate and engage. Savings targets is a tool where customers can set visual and concrete goals. They can also create a savings plan. The savings can then be tracked on a graph with the ability to simulate various future scenarios.

### The stock pages were updated with a new, simpler order process, and the transaction pages now provide a better overview of current orders and historical transactions. The technical analysis function was improved to make it easier to forecast future performance. New themes were added to Avanza Trackers for investments in renewable energy, digital economy, innovative technology and smart cities. The range of publicly traded products was expanded with new ETF’s.

### In occupational pensions, a new landing page, new product page and new onboarding process were launched to enable corporate customers to obtain occupational pension insurance directly on the site, regardless of number of employees.

###  Our customers

### The external mortgage offer was expanded with Landshypotek as a new lender. This made Avanza the first in Sweden to offer customers the option to apply for, track and manage mortgages from various lenders on a single platform. The collaboration broadens the offer with competitive interest rates while at the same time meeting the demand for mortgages with higher loan to value ratios, new purchases and second homes. The mortgage pages were also updated with an improved function to compare mortgages. Here customers can compare their mortgage with Avanza’s offering.

### A long-awaited Stop Loss function was launched in the apps to buy or sell shares at a predetermined price. At the same time, the function was expanded to include U.S. equities. In the apps, the pages for ETF’s, indexes, warrants and bonds were given a new design and new functions that enable technical analysis and comparisons of different instruments.

### A large part of the development work during the year was devoted to replacing the backoffice system. The new system will allow us to use smarter technology and solutions to increase efficiency, at the same time that scalability and product development are improved.

### Cheaper offers to fulfil our customer promise

### Fees are critical to the value of savings over time, and we want the barriers to entry for savings to be low. Avanza does not charge any fixed fees. This also applies to occupational pensions. We have free offers in every product area, and the price list is adapted to the customer’s activity level and capital to benefit each individual.

### To help more people start saving, Avanza since 2016 has a Start offer with free stock trading on the Stockholm Stock

### Exchange. The offer applies to customers with less than SEK 50,000 in savings capital. During the year, Start was expanded to include funds. This means that our customers are refunded all fund fees, including any exchange fees. All 1,350 funds on the platform are included.

### During the year, the Avanza Sverige, a Sweden equity index-tracking fund, was launched with exposure to the entire Swedish market at a low fee. Avanza Sverige tracks the Morningstar Sweden Sustainability Select 70, consisting of up to 70 companies. The management fee on the fund is 0.15 per cent.

### The Avanza Auto funds, which give customers access to automatically managed fund portfolios based on a chosen savings horizon and desired risk level, were given an update. The manage ment model has been re-evaluated and the management fee has been reduced from 0.35 per cent to 0.20 per cent. The total fee for the Auto funds is now capped at 0.40 per cent, including the cost of the underlying fund as well as transaction costs.

### Margin lending was expanded with more eligible securities. In addition, the interest rate for lending on funds was reduced. The benefit levels for margin lending were eliminated as well, which means the same low interest rate for everyone.

### A new law on pension transfers that took effect in April limits the fees charged on occupational pension transfers. This means that savers can transfer their unit-linked insurance to cheaper alternatives for a maximum cost of SEK 600, compared to the previous fee based on a percentage of capital. Avanza does not charge a percentage fee on pension capital and during the year we had a number of activities to inform customers of the opportunity to move their pension capital to Avanza.

### Our customers

### Continued high ratings from customers in 2021

### 2021 was a strong year, but in many ways challenging in terms of customer growth. Avanza has a highly scalable business model when it comes to technological platform and capacity, but nearly 700,000 new customers in two years also generates more phone calls and email and increases the pressure on customer-support functions. The strong growth caused excessively long response times by customer service last spring. Our most important long-term target is to win the Swedish Quality Index’s (SQI) annual award for Sweden’s most satisfied savers. During the summer, we therefore accelerated recruitment in customer-support functions.

### In December, we won the award in the savings category for the twelfth consecutive year. Our score for 2021 was 76.5 on a scale of 0—100. This was down from 80.4 in 2020, but Avanza still consolidated its strong position. The driving aspects in the survey are image, expectations, product quality, service and affordability. The highest score was receivied on loyalty. The survey also shows that Avanza has by far the lowest percentage of dissatisfied customers.

### SQI also includes a Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures customer experience and in Avanza’s case was 32 (67). Scores range from –100 to 100, with 0 to 50 being good and above that extremely good and highly unusual. Despite falling since 2020, Avanza’s score was far higher than the industry average of 7 (10).

### Avanza was ranked as having the highest reputation among banks and as the fourth most reputable company in Sweden in the Kantar Sifo reputation index 2021, an improvement from last year’s sixth place.

### In a survey by Reputation&Trust, Avanza was named the financial company in Sweden with the highest reputation. The survey shows how the public ranks the reputation of financial companies and how much they are trusted.

### In Navigator’s annual survey, Avanza was awarded for the best Banking & Finance blog. It was our broad-based content for those looking to learn about personal finances and Avanza’s engagement in social issues such as gender equality and sustainability that won over the respondents.

### In the YouGov BrandIndex, Avanza was the most recommended financial brand in Sweden and the second most recommended Swedish brand in any category.

### In Prospera’s Private Banking survey for 2021, Avanza ranked fifth for the fifth year in a row in competition with companies that offer investment advice and portfolio management. Avanza’s digital services and competitive prices ranked the highest of any company.

### These awards are recognition of our efforts to improve the customer experience by consistently prioritising customer value.

### Our fund marketplace offers 1,350 funds, including

### 17 of Avanza’s own

###  Using the fund marketplace, you can easily filter funds based on fund types, regions, sectors or various sustainability criteria such as low carbon risk, fossil-free or Nordic Swan Ecolabel funds. With the filtering, the best-performing fund in its category in the last year is presented on top of the list. If you need help with ideas, there is a fund inspiration option with lists of climate-smart winners, popular funds and top

### Our employees

### A strong culture with employees who are willing to challenge and want to create change

### Avanza is a company of dedicated employees who want to make a difference,  where everyone’s ideas are listened to and enrich our development. The foundation of our culture, and what drives us, is that we feel what we accomplish is meaningful

### and important.

### A strong corporate culture focused  on the customer

### We started Avanza with a simple idea — to build a company where we would want to be customers ourselves. In the same way, our aim has been to build a company where we thrive and would want to work. This has resulted in a very strong corporate culture that draws its energy from a vision to create a better future for millions of people. It is our position as a challenger and our employees’ willingness to change that has shaped the culture. The climate we have created is one of collaboration and humility, where we constantly challenge ourselves and think differently, and where everyone takes responsibility. Each quarter we reward an employee who has stood out in embracing our values, to encourage and nurture the entrepreneurial spirit that has gotten us where we are today.

### We have chosen to formulate our values, or guiding principles, in four short sentences. We help a colleague help a customer. We take responsibility. We challenge and think differently. We have fun together.

### All development is done internally

### We are constantly developing. There are always things that can be improved and new products and interfaces to develop. In recent years, investments have focused on digital decision support, an improved user experience and a stronger mobile offer. We have 29 development teams that are divided up based on the customer journey, products, business platform and technological platform. The goal of the technological platform teams is to optimise innovation, quality and lead times. The business platform teams are responsible for ensuring that the right techniques are used, so that we can achieve optimal efficiency and meet regulatory requirements and availability demands. This means eliminating old systems and future-proofing Avanza. The customer journey teams focus on the customer’s various stages, from joining Avanza to getting started and finding help, while the product teams are divided by product category. The agile organisational structure clarifies roles and mandates and contributes to increased stimulation and creativity among employees. The organisational structure contributes to a faster rate of development and happy and engaged employees.

### We want to create opportunities for our employees to grow by believing in their abilities and offering the flexibility to test new ideas and think differently. Our employees should feel that they have a say and can find an outlet for their creativity. One example of how we encourage them to express their ideas and innovate is our “Brainy Days”, when they can present ideas and try to convince colleagues to help develop them. These ideas are worked on over a two-day period, individually or together in teams, and then presented. Several ideas are further developed and put into production.

Our employees How we attract talented employees

### Recruitment and employer branding strategy Avanza’s success is closely tied to our attractiveness as an employer. Here our strong corporate culture, modern technology platform and agile way of working are important factors. The competition for talent is fierce, especially in technology. Avanza’s goal is to find the most competent and engaged employees with ambition and the drive to push the business forward and who fit into Avanza’s corporate culture.

### We continue to invest in this area and are working more systematically, proactively and strategically. Special attention is given to IT/Tech. To make sure that we are doing the right things, we measure Avanza’s progress in Universum’s ranking of “Attractive employers”. The results of the 2021 survey show improved rankings in all categories. Among Business and IT students, our rankings were 4th (10th) and 11th (20th) respectively, and among those with one to eight years of work experience Avanza came in 11th place (17th) for Business and 5th (16th) for IT. The longterm internal goal is to place in the top 10 in all four categories.

### In the Young Professional Attraction Index from Academic Work, Avanza ranked as the tenth most attractive employer in Sweden, and number one in finance.

### Succession planning and critical competence

### Each manager is responsible, with support from HR, for having the right staff on their team and workgroups, so that the work will be performed as effectively as possible. To ensure continuity and safeguard business-critical processes, a structured mapping of individuals with critical competence is done each year. Employee dialogues are conducted several times a year to follow up individual goals and development plans. To facilitate a smooth transition when employees in senior positions and other key employees move on to other roles, internal candidates are identified as part of succession planning.

### We work actively to maintain low employee turnover During the year, we continued to improve our goal-setting meetings and performance reviews in the employee dialogue, to identify employees who need further follow-up, development and challenges. This work includes increased leadership training and improved tracking of internal mobility and recruiting needs. We also use qualitative exit interviews and have a structured process to monitor new employees during their first three months. HR also actively participates in the recruiting process to ensure that we recruit the right people in terms of expectations and development potential in relation to the role, and that the candidate meets the competence requirements and fits our culture.

### Two groups within Avanza carry a higher risk of employee turnover: IT/Tech and customer service.

### For a number of years, there has been intense competition for IT development talent. This makes it challenging and time-consuming to recruit these positions, at the same time that the competence within Avanza is attractive to other companies. To reduce employee turnover in this area, we focus on leadership with experience of agile teams, and offer a work-life balance with the option of working from home to contribute to freedom and creativity. Market-based salaries are important as well.

###  The challenge with customer service is that it is demanding, sometimes stressful and fairly monotonous work, because of which employees do not stay as long in these roles. Some get the opportunity to transfer internally to other positions within Avanza. To reduce turnover in customer service, we make continuous improvements to our recruiting process to reach candidates of various ages, educations and backgrounds. To encourage personal development and reduce stress, we have also changed our internal processes and the way we work.

### Avanza is a growing entrepreneurial business with a low average age with a third of whom work in IT/Tech. In recent years, employee turnover has decreased. Our ambition is to maintain the current level of between 11 and 13 per cent.

### Gender equality and diversity – differences contribute  to a better corporate culture

### We feel that groups of people with different experiences and perspectives are more effective and dynamic than those who are far more alike. Putting together the right teams is an important management responsibility and a natural component of longterm HR management. We have an open and inclusive corporate culture that contributes to equality in the workplace, welcomes diversity and is free from harassment. At Avanza, we welcome you as you are.

### A gender perspective is important in recruiting to create great equality on a team level, in appointing senior managers and when analysing wages to avoid gender pay gaps and gender differences in sickness absences. Our annual workplace health survey contains a number of questions where we systematically monitor signs in terms of gender equality, diversity and harassment. The results are followed up by senior management and HR, and every manager is responsible for reviewing their team’s results.

### Gender equality is a focus area with the target of achieving parity between women and men. To this point, the number of men exceeds women among our employees, but the ratio is better when it comes to management. In IT/Tech, women are still underrepresented and we are working actively to broaden the range of candidates in our recruitments.

### To attract new talent to the field, we also invite candidates to various events and activities, such as IGEday, Introduce a Girl to Engineering day, to increase  interest in engineering among young women. We also collaborate with ”Girls Code”.

### Avanza was included in the Green List in the AllBright Report, which lists Sweden’s most gender diverse companies. The list consists of 67 listed Swedish companies.

### To increase the diversity of our employees, we have also been working for many years with companies that help people with disabilities or other backgrounds who are having difficulty gaining a foothold in the labour market.

### Avanza has a Group-wide policy on diversity and gender equality and has zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination and victimisation. Internally, executive management and each manager are responsible for compliance, although every employee is expected to take responsibility for their own actions. The CEO has overarching responsibility for the work with diversity and gender equality. Gender equality is addressed systematically through documentation, analyses, active measures, evaluations and follow-ups.

### Our diversity plan spells out how we work strategically to achieve even greater diversity. Recruiting is a focus area to ensure that we have an unbiased process and that all available positions are formulated in a gender-neutral way, partly to avoid discriminating and partly to attract candidates with range of qualifications. We have also provided internal training for all managers to encourage competence-based and unbiased recruiting.

### 33

### Our employees

### Avanza’s operations do not pose a material risk of human rights violations, directly or indirectly, other than in the fund company’s management. As a result, we have no formalised oversight, policy or performance monitoring in this area. We have a code of conduct with guidance for employees on business ethics and how we maintain fair and lawful business relationships, and we follow international and national codes of conduct in the industry.

### Incentive programmes and efforts to ensure equal pay Avanza mainly pays fixed remuneration. Only a few employees in Corporate Finance and Brokerage receive variable remuneration. The CEO or the Board of Directors decide on variable remuneration. Avanza works continuously to ensure equal pay. This is done in among other ways through a job evaluation process, which serves as a basis for the annual salary survey and is used in connection with new hires and internal mobility. Parity is a factor in all wage-setting. HR is involved to ensure a fair, equal, quality-assured process. Prior to the salary audit, a survey is conducted, along with an analysis of proposed pay adjustments during the audit and a final survey of the outcome. Differences that are not based on objective facts are investigated before the audit is approved.

### Because of the importance of the corporate culture and to recruit and retain competent and engaged employees, it is also critical that Avanza offers an incentive programme that allows all permanent employees to become shareholders in the company. We do so through our warrant programme, see pages 38 and 46 for more information.

### Opportunity to develop in a stimulating environment

### To give our employees the best chance of living up to their full potential, skills are taught on a daily basis on the job as well as through internal and external training. Helping employees to develop in their roles is important. All employees have a personal development plan that is followed up three times a year through the employee dialogue.

### All employees are also offered internal training through the Avanza Academy to get to know our business. The Academy offers periodic training in our various product areas, held by key employees in these areas. Moreover, all employees receive training in regulations, risk management and IT security as well as internal governance and control, to ensure understanding and competence. Training is offered through continuously updated, web-based nano programmes. There is also an annual trainee programme for developers, which is offered to four to six recent graduates who join our development teams for six months, after which many go on to become employees of Avanza.

###  New employees receive introductory training where Avanza’s business, strategy, goals, vision and product areas are presented, along with compliance, risk and security. They also receive training on the regulations that govern Avanza’s various operations. The training also includes an introduction to Avanza’s culture and values.

### In customer service, we offer various programmes according to a special development ladder depending on how many months or years an employee has been with Avanza. Each step qualifies them for new opportunities and career stages. We are also continuously developing our feedback culture. This is done through the employee dialogue and feedback buddies as well as regular conversations between employees and their managers.

### Focus on leadership

### Leadership and employeeship at Avanza require understanding and taking responsibility, being a good communicator and ambassador, and being able to coach others and help them develop. Our leaders are an important part of Avanza’s development and success. To ensure that everyone has the skills and tools they need as leaders, we provide internal and external training. Introductory leadership training is based on neuropsychology to increase self-awareness and develop personal leadership, also known as self-leadership. Leadership training is offered to all managers with personnel responsibility and is designed in modular form. In addition to the leadership programme, Avanza arranges leadership days, a managers’ café and monthly luncheons.

### Leadership appraisals by employees are regularly tracked through pulse surveys.

### A positive work environment means healthy and motivated employees

### We offer our employees a secure employment and workplace. We prefer to hire our employees and therefore have a limited number of consultants in the business. This is the best way, we feel, to create engagement and participation.

### Avanza has an occupational health and safety committee comprised of representatives from both the employer and employees. It meets quarterly and works proactively with various measures to improve the work environment. Avanza also has an action plan and routines to handle incidents that affect our employees. This includes incidents involving discrimination and victimisation. During the year, we have not been made aware about such incidents.

### We want employees to maintain a work-life balance and handle a high-performance environment sustainably over time.

### Salary data

### Women’s wages as a proportion of men’s salary

### 2021	2020	2019	2018	2017

### Employees have access to a number of benefits to stay healthy and maintain a balance, such as wellness allowances, activities through our sports club, parental benefits, crisis management assistance, and health and rehabilitation insurance.

### Avanza supports the rights of its employees to unionise and collectively negotiate. At the same time, we believe in the abilities and participation of the individual and have chosen not to enter into collective bargaining agreements. Avanza offers similar terms compared to relevant collective agreements.

### The work environment is measured and followed up regularly in pulse surveys.

### Impact and management of Covid-19

### Also 2021 was a different year due to the pandemic. Avanza has followed the Swedish Public Health Agency’s recommendations and instructions. The majority of employees have worked remotely. To improve home workspaces and facilitate remote work, employees have been offered up to SEK 2,000. New communication channels and routines have been adopted to manage the business, the pace of development and engagement among employees, and to safeguard the culture. The new employee introduction has been done digitally as well. Exclusively digital communication has in many cases increased the availability of our employees, which is important to building Avanza’s culture and cohesion. Many of these new and flexible ways of working are here to stay, at the same time that spontaneous interactions with colleagues shouldn’t be underestimated.

###  Because we care about individual flexibility, we will maintain an open and trusting approach to remote work, depending on the position and role. Ultimately it is up to each employee and manager to agree on. At the same time, we have a strong corporate culture at Avanza and want to create a workplace where we are comfortable and want to be. Physical proximity and communication between colleagues creates the best opportunities to doing a good job and strengthen the culture.

### Benefits 1)

### Our employees

### High engagement and recommendation rate among employees

### We measure employee engagement and well-being through pulse surveys three times a year. The surveys ensure a continuous dialogue on how employees feel about their jobs, so that we can build an even better workplace together. The questions in each survey are tied to Engagement, Leadership and the Work environment, where the goal is an index score of 80 in each area; see the table on page 32. We see these areas, along with eNPS, as cornerstones to create a strong and engaged culture. Our pulse surveys for 2021 showed an average eNPS score of 67 (69). The main reasons why our employees recommend Avanza are still strongly linked to our corporate culture, where there is a sense of pride and responsibility for the company and a feeling that what we accomplish is meaningful and important.

### Risk profile

### Limited financial risks and strong focus on IT and information security

### Our customers expect a high level of availability and security on the platform. This, together with rapid technological development and growing digital threats, makes IT and information security critical for Avanza.

### Strong focus on IT and information security

### Avanza’s operations are largely digital, which makes stability, availability and IT and information security critical to ensure long-term customer relations, trust and protect economic value. This requires  a comprehensive security strategy for the whole IT area.

### We continuously invest resources to develop our competencies and capabilities. Avanza cooperates with industry colleagues through the Swedish Bankers’ Association to share experiences, insights and advice. The goal is to strengthen awareness of IT and information security and at the same time put the right talent in place to proactively reduce risks. We regularly test and evaluate technical and organisational safeguards. Our employees receive training in risk management and security, including web-based training, which is followed up with control questions. IT and information security is also part of the introductory training for new employees to ensure that they have sufficient knowledge in this area. The Board and management receive regular training as well.

### The purpose of information security is to protect our customers’ and Avanza’s data and other sensitive information. Late spring it was found that Avanza, due to a handling error, had inadvertently activated functions on its website which enabled Facebook to collect personal data from Avanza’s website in encrypted form. The functions were turned off as soon as this was detected. The data was hashed, a simpler form of encryption. Facebook had the possibility to use the information, but it is not clear to what extent this could have occurred. If Facebook has used the information, which we do not know, it has only related to Avanza’s own marketing. Facebook has confirmed that the information has not been used for its own or other firms’ commercial purposes and that the information has been deleted. When we realised that the information had been shared, Avanza reported itself to the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) and the Swedish FSA for a potential breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our assessment is that no customers were put at harm. The case is ongoing.

### The availability of the platform and our services is ensured e.g. by maintaining redundant data centres independent of each other. Trading activity among Avanza’s customers has been historically high during the pandemic, and at the start of which work was done to stabilise and strengthen IT systems. In 2021, Avanza’s platform was available 99.9 (99.9) per cent of the time.

### During the year, Avanza created a better infrastructure for testing and IT security. The company is working proactively and continuously to replace hardware and software with more modern solutions to stay on the forefront and avoid technical debt. Investments were made in 2021 to replace the backoffice system, which will allow Avanza to use smarter technology and solutions that increase efficiencies, at the same time that scalability and opportunities for product development is improved. We thoroughly test performance and new functionality before release in production. In addition, weekly site updates and improvements further reduce operational risk. This also applies to the apps.

### Third Party Players and significant counterparties

### Avanza offers its own and distributes others’ savings and mortgage products. The offering is presented objectively with both advantages and disadvantages, and without promoting individual products. Avanza does not offer investment advice.

### The majority of Avanza’s suppliers provide financial products and services and are overseen by the Swedish FSA or similar foreign authorities, and/or are subject to the rules of various stock exchanges. Close collaborations and agreements with suppliers always entail a risk, however. To better understand the counterparty, and thereby identify and minimise any business or reputational risks, we work systematically to control and monitor Third Party Players and other significant counterparties. Counterparty assessments are done for among other reasons to ensure that the counterparty has the correct authorisation and is not involved in any legal disputes or enforcement actions that could potentially impact the company’s reputation or financial stability. In certain cases, more detailed reviews and supplier visits are conducted as well. Follow-ups are done annually or when there is an indication of a change in risk level.

### Avanza’s largest service suppliers are Nasdaq, Euroclear Sweden and NGM. Among the most important third party collaborators are fund management companies, our partners in deposit accounts and mortgages, and Avanza Markets. In connection with transactions such as an IPO or rights issue, Avanza works exclusively with established counterparties on the Swedish financial market. In transactions where Avanza is the lead and only advisor, thorough due diligence is performed to ensure that the company complies with stock exchange rules and listing requirements. As a step in limiting sustainability risks in the fund company’s investments, all external funds that its funds invest in must meet the Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) and have a policy for responsible investments and shareholder engagement. Low financial risks

### Avanza’s financial risks, such as credit risks, market risks and liquidity risks, are limited. Avanza does not offer traditional consumer credit or engage in proprietary trading. The balance sheet largely consists of assets and liabilities in the insurance business. It is the policyholders who bear the direct investment risk, so they also retain the yield on these assets. This means that the value of insurance liabilities, by definition, tracks the value of insurance assets. Avanza Pension does not offer any insurance products with a guaranteed return.

### The liability side of the balance sheet mainly consists of customer deposits. Avanza is self-financed through shareholders’ equity and customer deposits. Only a limited share of deposits is used for lending with longer contractual maturities, which creates a low liquidity risk. Lending in relation to deposits amounted to 37 (37) per cent at year end.

### With regard to credit risk, all lending is collateralised by liquid financial assets with good collateral margins or Swedish residential properties with a low loan to value (LTV) ratio. Margin lending requires collateral in listed securities with good liquidity. Avanza offers mortgages to private banking customers with a LTV ratio not exceeding 50 per cent and where SEK 3 million in savings is required. The low ratio should ensure that the collateral is adequate, even in the event of a sharp drop in property prices. The average LTV ratio at year end was 41 per cent. The low credit risk makes the loan book resilient even accounting for climate-related risks. Concentration risk is managed by normally limiting individual mortgages to SEK 10 million and by ensuring that the collateral in any one security represents only a limited share of the total collateral. Avanza has not found it necessary to amend its credit strategy due to transition- or climate-related risks. In the case of the external mortgages, Avanza is only a distributor, meaning it does not affect Avanza’s balance sheet, nor does it mean a credit risk for Avanza.

### Surplus liquidity is managed effectively with the lowest risks and costs possible, within the framework of the limits placed by the leverage ratio and net stable funding ratio (NSFR). Surplus liquidity is invested mainly in covered bonds and with the Riksbank and systemically important Nordic credit institutions. The liquidity portfolio is managed with a balanced maturity structure of between one and five years, where the average interest term is normally maximum three months. Surplus liquidity as of 31 December was SEK 35 billion including client fund receivables. For further information, see Note 35 Financial risks.

### Sustainability risks

### Managing sustainability risks responsibly is critical. Climate change poses a risk to many sectors of society, which in turn represents a risk to the financial sector. It is important to understand how climate change can affect our operations and the return on customer funds in both the short and long term. Besides the risk, however, there are opportunities, where political decisions, technological advances and demand from stakeholders will have a great impact. Regulatory changes and social activism targeted at unsustainable business models could affect Avanza’s reputation as well.

### Climate risks are usually divided into physical and transition risks. Physical risks are the risks of physical destruction due to such climate impacts as droughts, floods and forest fires. Transition risks are risks of negative financial consequences from society’s transition to becoming more sustainable from a climate perspective.

### Avanza’s climate- and sustainability-related risks, both financial and nonfinancial, are reported in accordance with the recom mendations of the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

### Governance

### Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities begins with the Board of Directors of Avanza Bank Holding AB, which among other things decides on issues concerning Avanza’s strategic direction, including the sustainability strategy and targets. This also includes policy documents, which together with the

###  Risk profile

### sustainability strategy provide the basis of Avanza’s sustainability work. The CEO is responsible for day-to-day management. To support the sustainability work, the CEO has established a sustainability committee.

### Strategy and risk management

### Risks and opportunities have been identified in operations, as well as the potential effect they could have in the short and long term. This is part of the assessment of whether Avanza’s strategy is aligned with among other things the Paris Agreement. The climate- and sustainability-related risks and opportunities that Avanza has identified are described below, with how they are assessed and managed.

### Climate and sustainability risks tied to the balance sheet On the asset side, Avanza has exposure to municipalities in the form of the municipal bonds in the liquidity portfolio. The exposure is limited in terms of both amount (max 20 per cent) and rating (AAA/A1). If a municipality incurs higher climate-related costs, thereby affecting its credit worthiness and credit spread, the short average maturity also means that a change in credit rating would have a very limited impact on the portfolio.

### Sustainability and climate-related risks are also considered low in the credit portfolio – even in cases where the underlying collateral for Avanza’s Private Banking mortgages is in geographically vulnerable areas, which could affect the collateral’s value. The loan value in the portfolio remains low and mortgage customers are usually over-collateralised. If the underlying collateral decreases significantly in value, it is captured in the annual revaluation, which can trigger amortisation requirements.

### In Avanza’s margin lending, environmental and climate-related risks could have an indirect impact since the loan is strictly used to finance investments in securities. Transition and climate- related risks that an issuer is exposed to through its business model are normally reflected in the asset’s volatility and therefore taken into account in assessing the value of the collateral. This would trigger a re-evaluation of the LTV ratio, which if necessary would be lowered for the individual issuer.

### Climate and sustainability risks tied to the business  operations

### To help customers make sustainable choices and minimise the climate risk in their investments, Avanza is developing various tools and providing information and education on sustainable savings. For more information, see pages 26–27.

### In the corporate finance business, assignments where the underlying environmental and climate-related risks are disregarded could have a negative impact on Avanza’s reputation and brand. This type of risk is addressed by the bank’s investment committee when deciding whether to accept an advisory assignment.

### In the fund management company, ignoring sustainability considerations in the management of the funds could have a detrimental effect on both performance and reputation. Special criteria for responsible investments have been designed for funds of funds. The underlying funds they invest in must live up to the same criteria as the fund of funds. Sustainability risks are taken into account by excluding companies with revenue from controversial sectors and companies that violate international norms and conventions. By including funds that promote environmental and social development, so-called light green funds according to article 8 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), sustainability risks are further reduced.

### Risk profile

### The funds of funds also have a limit in terms of companies that sell coal, chemical and biological weapons, cluster bombs, land mines, nuclear weapons as a means to reduce the climate risks in their investments. For more information, see page 26.

### Risks associated with personnel and social issues

### Avanza’s success is highly dependent on strong employee engagement and the success in retaining employees and attracting new talent. Avanza’s corporate culture, modern platform and technology choices, coupled with the way we work and our values, are important to remain attractive as an employer. In Universum’s survey of Sweden’s most popular employers in 2021, Avanza ranked highest of all financial companies. Avanza has a recruiting policy, diversity and gender equality policy, and occupational health and safety policy, which ensure that these issues are addressed. See pages 32–36 for more information.

### Human rights risks

### Avanza’s code of conduct outlines and describes our values and business ethics. The code applies to board members, managers and all employees of Avanza regardless of form of employment. Sustainability is incorporated in Avanza Fonder’s funds of funds based on the opt-out principle. The funds of funds exclude funds which invest in companies that do not follow international norms and conventions with respect to the environment, human rights, working conditions and business ethics e.g. the UN Global Compact and OECD Guidelines for Multinationals. Beyond that, Avanza’s operations do not entail a material risk of violating human rights, whether directly or indirectly.

### Anti-money laundering and terrorist financing

### We work actively to prevent and combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The goal is to effectively and efficiently minimise the risk that the products and services Avanza offers are used in financial crime. It is critical to our work that we know our customers and properly understand the risk of being exploited.

### At least once a year, Avanza’s board and CEO establishes a Group-wide policy and guidelines that serves as a framework for Avanza’s AML/CTF work. We are proactive in managing this risk through our Know-Your-Customer process and by analysing improprieties on a continuous basis. We have routines to investigate and report suspicious activity to the Financial Intelligence Unit within the Swedish Police. Internal training programmes are in place to ensure that employees have the knowledge they need, in addition to which all employees receive basic training each year.

### Avanza serves Swedish customers, and to be a customer of Avanza you must also have an account with another Swedish bank. Our aim, using a risk-based approach, is to continuously improve both automatic and manual customer processes and routines.

### Compliance risks

### Avanza operates under the supervision of the Swedish FSA. The financial sector is strictly regulated, which places high demands on compliance with applicable financial and ethical rules.

### Avanza places the highest priority on lawful and ethical conduct and has established internal rules, routines and processes to ensure that Avanza is in compliance with regulations. All employees have a clearly stated responsibility to follow these rules, routines and processes. A key element of compliance work is good internal governance, risk management and control, as well as a sound risk culture, which the Board of Directors and the CEO are ultimately responsible for.

### In accordance with the three lines of defence principle, Avanza has established an independent compliance function, which is directly subordinate to the CEO. Compliance is responsible for verifying that the licensed operations comply with laws, regulations and internal rules, including by helping them identify their compliance risks and independently monitoring and controlling that the business has the proper routines and controls in place to manage the risks. Moreover, Compliance is responsible for ensuring that employees are informed and educated on new or amended rules applicable to licensed operations.

### Stress tests ensure that Avanza’s strategic and business model is resilient in the event of a more negative climate scenario

### This year, for the first time, Avanza’s strategic and business model was stress tested based on various climate scenarios. This work was reported to the Board’s Risk, Capital and Audit Committee and included in the annual own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA), which the board establishes and which is sent to the Swedish FSA. The stress test has used the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA), an open platform to measure whether an investment portfolio is aligned with the commitments of the Paris Agreement. With the help of PACTA, customers’ investments are categorised into climate-relevant sectors such as energy, oil & gas and coal mining.

### The various scenarios have used one assumption where customers are passive and hold onto the same assets and one which assumes that they are active and act rationally by reweighting over a five-year period from the four categories Energy, Oil & Gas, Coal and Material production to more sustainable asset categories. Since the business plan does not stretch to either 2030 nor 2050, the outcomes from the two climate scenarios are compared against each other. The business plan is followed to 2024 in terms of volumes, earnings and costs per transaction, and insurance capital. To isolate the climate effect, the net inflow is assumed to be zero. Revenue and expenses are held constant from 2024 and all generated results are distributed to the shareholders. This is done to avoid inflating the balance sheet and to isolate the climate impact.

### The stress test showed that the direct exposure to physical risks due to climate change was very limited. The transition to a more sustainable, fossil-free economy creates transition risks for Avanza, since our earnings are largely tied to the value of customers’ investments and how actively customers trade. In both the passive and active scenario, the stress test showed very little effect. The low exposure to the directly affected industries is an important reason. Even if the analysis itself shows very little effect, sustainable assets are expected to generate fairly different returns in each scenario. While this is only marginally captured in the analysis, it is considered to have a fairly big impact on customers’ savings capital and Avanza’s earnings over this long period of time. The extent is highly uncertain, however. Individual customers may have a greater exposure to particular sectors, which is why it is important that Avanza continues to offer sustainable investment alternatives as well as inform and inspire customers to make sustainable choices.

### Target and measure

### Avanza follows a number of key figures and indicators linked to our operations and sustainability work, which are based on three focus areas. Read more on pages 20–21 and 24–25.

### Earnings risk

### An important part of Avanza’s risk management is to evaluate and challenge our business model when it comes to earnings risks. Earnings risk is managed by continuously improving and broadening our offer to ensure high customer value and broader, more diversified earnings. Continued strong growth in the number of customers and savings capital, along with increased cost efficiency, improves economies of scale and makes Avanza more competitive. Avanza continuously monitors the market and its pricing in order to respond to changes in customer preferences and market developments through planned measures and adjustments to the business model.

### Internal capital and liquidity assessment (ICAAP)

### Each year Avanza performs an ICAAP to analyse all the material risks that Avanza is, or could be, exposed to based on established business and financing plans. The aim is to ensure that Avanza has sufficient capital, liquidity and assets of lasting value to cover unexpected losses, outflows and customers’ liquidity needs, even under unfavourable conditions.

### The size of Avanza’s capital and liquidity is ultimately linked to the viability and resilience of the business model. The ICAAP models the income statement and balance sheet in a baseline scenario and stress tests them for possible economic slowdowns, strategic risk factors identified in business and financing plans, and other relevant scenarios over a three-year period. The effect of unfavourable conditions is analysed based on capital and liquidity needs.

### The result of the 2021 ICAAP reflects Avanza’s low risk exposure and shows the resilience of Avanza’s business model, even under highly stressed conditions. Avanza’s capital base at no points falls below the capital adequacy requirements stipulated by the Swedish FSA.

### Own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA)

###  The ORSA measures total solvency capital for the insurance group, corresponding to the capital required to remain a going concern in the short and long term. Avanza starts here with its own risk profile, risk tolerance and business strategy, and the capital requirement is evaluated in relation to the insurance group’s assessment of risk and the regulatory solvency capital requirement. ORSA is an important part of corporate governance and risk management and requires the company to stay informed of, and be able to assess, all its risks. ORSA is an integral part of Avanza’s business strategies. This means that the result of the ORSA is taken into account in strategic decisions and business planning.

### Scenario-based tests are conducted in the ORSA to obtain a forward-looking assessment of the solvency situation and thereby evaluate the insurance group’s ability to meet its obligations in stressed situations. Among the factors that are stressed are volumes, market conditions, costs, earnings, climate change and the risk that customers leave Avanza.

### The result of the 2021 ORSA shows that the insurance group is well capitalised and can withstand stress, and that measures can be taken fairly easily to restore the solvency ratio even in severe situations.

### Risk profile

### Capital planning

### Avanza’s capitalisation is governed by the regulation requiring a leverage ratio of 3 per cent, which was introduced at mid-2021. In addition, the Swedish FSA is introducing a Pillar 2 guidance, which means an additional safety margin. In 2021, the Swedish FSA announced the guidance for an industry peer of an additional 0.9 per cent. The guidance for Avanza is expected to be finalised 2022, once the Swedish FSA has completed its review and evaluation of Avanza. To maintain a good margin to the requirement regardless of market conditions, the board has previously set the internal leverage ratio target at 3.8 per cent. Avanza’s leverage ratio for the consolidated situation was 4.8 (4.9) per cent at year end, and for the bank 4.4 (4.3) per cent. The leverage ratio is strengthened through increased Tier 1 capital and/or decreased deposits on the balance sheet.

### The total capital requirement for the consolidated situation was 12.6 (13.1) per cent at year end. Avanza’s total capital ratio was 24.0 (24.4) per cent.

### Group recovery plan

### Avanza prepares an annual Group recovery plan to prepare the Board and management for potentially severe financial situations. The 2021 recovery plan has been approved by Avanza’s Board.

### In the plan, recovery measures are identified to restore capital, liquidity and profitability. Also included are indicators that we regularly monitor to identify in time whether recovery measures are needed. Avanza’s financial situation is also stressed in several scenarios. In all these scenarios, Avanza is placed in a recovery situation to evaluate whether the measures Avanza has identified are sufficient without exposing customers to risk.

Chairman's comment Chairman's comment

### What happens when you don’t practice  what you preach

### 2021 was another outstanding year for Avanza and Rikard has discussed the most important milestones elsewhere. Our customers have done well. Avanza has done well. An ideal outcome.

### For the 12th year in a row, we won the Swedish Quality Index award for Sweden’s most satisfied savings customers, which is especially gratifying since it is given by our customers. Winning it has even been a goal of ours, and there is always a sense of nervousness before the results are announced in December of each year.

### 2022 will in all likelihood see higher demands for  a good return without raising risk

### When talking about risks, I would like to say something about the risks and anomalies in 2021.

### The markets are naturally steered mainly by facts, but various forums, where people act anonymously, are gaining influence over stock prices. The cynic might see this as a natural phenomenon at a market peak. And it could very well be, but that doesn’t justify it. It used to be easier to trace the sources of false and accurate information that could affect share prices, but with these chat sites, which are usually anonymous, it is harder to figure out.

### This leaves a lot of the onus on our customers to distinguish between false and accurate information. Last year’s most hyped stock was GameStop, whose price soared fuelled by a forum on Reddit in the US and in two weeks was up 1,500% after a short squeeze. This means that the investors who had shorted the share were forced to accept the skyrocketing prices to buy back those shorted shares when the borrowers demanded them.

### “ I see our customers as cautious and fact-based investors”

Sven Hagströmer, Chairman of the Board

### It is interesting to see how many Avanza customers bought GameStop stock and how much was involved. About 33,000 owned the share and their median holding never exceeded SEK 10,000. In other words, less than 3% of our customers tested

### their luck on GameStop. The percentage of customers and the average amount say a lot about our customers as being cautious and fact-based investors.

### I would like to add here that Avanza was started with the aim of giving customers a well-stocked toolbox to make their own informed investment decisions. The toolbox is constantly updated to be effective and as widely available as possible.

### “ We want to give our customers a good toolbox to make informed decisions”

### Avoid specific advice but listen to the general As a long-time investor and founder of Avanza, I often meet other investors in various contexts.

### The basic concept when it comes to investing in stocks is to avoid buying a Fiat today when you could buy a Mercedes, or why not a Tesla, tomorrow. This is the difference, but today we are bombarded too often by, “Buy Now, Pay Later”.

### The highlight of these meetings is usually when I am expected to offer specific advice. This is something I always avoid, however, since advice by its nature evolves. I know that when I meet these people a buy recommendation can change to a hold or maybe even a sell.

### On the other hand, I usually give two general pieces of advice, which I have mentioned here before:

### Q Buy shares in companies whose products you understand.

### Q Buy shares in companies where you are satisfied customer.

### It is easy to give others advice, but have I followed it myself?

### In the case of Avanza and Creades, I no doubt have. Here I hope and believe that both companies will continue to fulfil their potential.

### Instead I would rather discuss when I failed to practice what I preach and what it cost. Hopefully, it will inspire someone to make better decisions.

###  Chairman's comment

### “ I have always been interested in technology and saw the opportunities when I created Avanza”

### I have been interested in technology from the age of 12, when I received my library card at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I started Avanza when I saw the opportunities that the Internet had created.

### So far, so good. But when it comes to the Tesla, I totally blew it. I loved the car from the first time I saw it. But I thought the stock was too expensive. What did I do? Well, I thought I was being very smart by buying a Tesla in the belief that it was a better investment than the share. I am still a very satisfied Tesla owner. Until the other day when I did a calculation. I shouldn’t have bothered. Had I combined my Tesla purchase and as a very satisfied customer bought shares for the same amount, I would have been able to buy 23 brand-new Teslas today. All that in almost exactly 8 years.

### It is little consolation, but I am not alone. This is a fairly typical stock market story. The biggest mistake you can make as an investor is not to stick to your discipline. I know!

### I will not make you to hear another story but if I say that I bought my first Apple computer, an Apple II, in 1981, I think you can guess.

### Always practice what you preach.

### Stockholm in February 2022

### Corporate governance report

### We want to create a better future for millions of people. The key to success is a high level of trust and the most satisfied customers. It is our firm conviction that it is through customer value that we create the best shareholder value.

Avanza’s Corporate governance report has been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the Code). Avanza Bank Holding AB (publ), hereafter “Avanza”, does not deviate from the Code. As a publicly listed Swedish limited liability company, Avanza’s operations are also governed by other laws and regulations, including the Swedish Companies Act, Nasdaq’s Nordic Main Market Rulebook for Issuers of Shares and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The operating subsidiaries are subject to the supervision of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA), which requires strict application of various financial and ethical rules and guidelines based on Swedish and European law and the Swedish Securities Markets Association’s guidelines. Avanza is driven by a strong customer focus and an ambition to provide a world-class user experience and customer service. We believe our offer must stand the test of time. We do not offer investment advice and instead inspire and educate customers to make informed savings and investments decisions. Our promise is that customers will have more money left in their own pockets with Avanza than with any other bank. In the long term, what we do benefits the Swedish savings market and the industry’s development, which in turn has a positive effect on society as a whole. From a societal and sustainability perspective we also promote an increased share of sustainable investments. This is done by facilitating sustainable investment choices and by educating and challenging. An important part of the sustainability work is a sustainable organisation with thorough oversight and control. We are working actively to increase gender equality and diversity. To achieve our vision and promote a better savings market in the long term, we have to maintain a dialogue with and listen to our stakeholders. We have to earn their trust every day and preferably surpass their highest expectations. These stakeholders include customers, employees, owners, partners, media, suppliers, authorities and legislators, all of whom affect and are affected by our operations. A. Ownership and voting rights The share capital consists of one class of shares. All shares confer the same rights. There are no limitations on the right to transfer shares or how many votes a shareholder may cast. The share is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm’s Large Cap list. The share capital at the end of 2021 amounted to SEK 77,785,879, represented by 155,571,758 shares and votes. An ownership distribution is presented on page 39. The largest shareholders are represented on the Nomination Committee and in the nomination process,for the election of Board members and the auditor; see below. Avanza has three outstanding warrant programmes comprising warrants with the right to subscribe for 5,700,000 new shares with a maximum dilution of 3.7 per cent. Of the total number of outstanding warrants, 40 per cent were transferred to employees at year-end. Two additional incentive plans were established by the AGM 2021. They comprise a total of 2,400,000 warrants and cannot be transferred until 2022 and 2023, when the existing incentive plans expire. For further information on the Avanza share, see pages 38–39 and Note 29 Equity. B. Nomination process for election of Board members and auditor The AGM 2020 established the nomination process for the election of Board members and the auditor as well as the appointment of a Nomination Committee. The principles for the nomination process apply until further notice. The names of the Nomination Committee’s members, and the shareholders they represent, were published on 24 September 2021, more than six months before the date of the AGM 2022. The Nomination Committee consists of one representative from each of the four largest shareholders wishing to appoint a representative, based on ownership interests known immediately before the announcement. The Nomination Committee is a governing body of the AGM with the sole purpose to prepare the AGM’s resolutions on election, and directors as well as auditors’ fees. The Nomination Committee is mandated to serve until a new committee is appointed. In accordance with the nomination process, the Chairman of the Committee is the member representing the largest shareholder, unless the Nomination Committee has agreed otherwise. A shareholder who after the publication of the Committee members is no longer among the four largest shareholders must make their seat available in favour of the shareholder who became one of the four largest. Marginal changes do not have to be considered. Shareholders appointing a representative to the Committee have the right to dismiss this representative and appoint a replacement. All changes to the composition of the Committee shall be publically announced. The Nomination Committee’s proposals for resolution at the AGM: Q Chairman of the Meeting Q Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board Q Board fees Q auditor and fees for the Company’s auditors Q if appropriate, changes in the procedure for appointing the Nomination Committee
Composition of the Nomination Committee Representing,
Erik Törnberg (Chairman of the Nomination Committee)	Creades AB,15,593,000 (10.1%) 15, 593 ,000 (10.0 %)
Sven Hagströmer (Chairman of the Board of Avanza)	Hagströmer family and companies	15,667,230 (10.1%) 15,667,230 (10.1%) Moritz Sitte Baillie Gifford & Co 15,671,559 (10.1%) 15,671,559 (10.1%) Peter Guve AMF Pension & Fonder 9,236,966 (6.0%) 9,451,966 (6.1%),

### The Nomination Committee’s proposal to the Board of Directors is presented in its entirety to ensure that the composition of the Board meets competence, diversity and independence requirements. Shareholders with views on the Board’s composition or proposals for new members shall submit them to the Nomination Committee well in advance of the AGM. Nomination proposals are reviewed as part of the nomination process. Proposals shall be sent to valberedningen@avanza.se or to:

### Avanza Bank Holding AB

### F.A.O.: Valberedningen

### Box 1399

### 111 93 Stockholm

### Although Committee members are not remunerated for their work, Avanza refunds reasonable costs deemed necessary for them to undertake their duties. The Committee has agreed that Erik Törnberg, Creades AB, will remain in the position of Chairman of the Committee.

### The Nomination Committee’s proposals, as well as a reasoned opinion on the proposal and a report on the Committee’s work, are published in conjunction with the notice of the AGM. When preparing its proposal for Board fees, the Nomination Committee uses comparisons to companies operating in similar spheres and with a similar size and complexity. Proposed fees shall be market rate based on the responsibility and work required and on the contribution the Board can make to the Company’s development.

### As a diversity policy, the Nomination Committee has applied section 4.1 in the Code. Although the Nomination Committee has sought a gender balance among AGM-elected Board members, the share of women has been lower than the Swedish Corporate Governance Board’s ambition. In 2021 the Board of Directors consisted of seven men and two women. For more information, see section F. Board of Directors.

### The Nomination Committee held 3 meetings in 2021, at which all members were present. The Nomination Committee also conducted an evaluation of the Board and its work, where the Board’s size, composition, industry experience and competence were evaluated.

### C. Annual General Meeting (AGM)

###  Shareholders exercise influence over Avanza through participation at the AGM, Avanza’s most senior decision-making body. In accordance with the Articles of Association, the AGM elects the Company’s Board members and appoints Avanza’s auditors.

### In addition, decisions are taken on adoption of the income statement and balance sheet, consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet, dividends and other profit distributions, discharge from liability of the members of the Board and the CEO, the nomination procedure, remuneration guidelines for senior management, and other important issues.

### To exercise their vote at the AGM, shareholders usually have to be present at the meeting in person or by proxy. In addition, they must be registered in their own name in the share register on the specified date prior to the meeting and have notified Avanza of their participation as set out in the notice. Due to the pandemic, temporary rules were in place in 2021 that allowed shareholders to vote by post or digitally.

### The AGM’s resolutions normally pass with a simple majority,

### i.e. more than half of the total number of votes cast, unless otherwise specified by the Swedish Companies Act. Shareholders wishing to add a matter to the agenda at the AGM may submit a written request. Such requests must be received by the date indicated on Avanza’s website, which for the AGM 2022 was 10 February 2022. Requests are to be sent to:

### Avanza Bank Holding AB

### F.A.O: Bolagsjuridik

### Box 1399

### 111 93 Stockholm

### The date and time of the next AGM, and information on how shareholders can exercise their right of initiative, are posted on Avanza’s website under the Governance section at the latest in conjunction with the publication of the third interim report of the year preceding the AGM. Minutes and supporting documentation from previous AGMs are also available in the same section.

### Extraordinary General Meetings may be held if the Board deems necessary or if the Company’s auditor or a shareholder holding at least ten per cent of the shares requests such a meeting.

### At Avanza’s AGM on 30 March 2021, 246 shareholders were represented with a holding corresponding to 47 per cent of the total number of shares and votes. Due to the pandemic, the AGM was held without physical presence. Voting was conducted by mail or digitally prior to the AGM. To enable shareholders to ask questions before the AGM, a separate digital information meeting was held in Swedish with the CEO and the Chairman of the Board. Avanza’s CEO also held a presentation.

### In addition to the annually recurring matters, the following re solutions were also adopted by the AGM 2021:

### Q amendment to the Articles of Association on which date a shareholder must be listed in the shareholder register to be entitled to participate in the AGM

### Q issuance of warrants for employee incentive programmes

### Q authorisation for the Board to acquire own shares

### The AGM approved three incentive programmes, the last of which expires in November 2026. The three incentive programmes comprise a total of 3,600,000 warrants, corresponding to 1,200,000 per programme, which entitle holders to subscribe for a corresponding number of shares. Warrants corresponding to 651,630 shares have been transferred, equivalent to a subscription rate of 45 per cent for the first programme. If all the warrants in the three programmes approved by AGM 2021 were exercised, the dilution effect would be below 2.3 per cent.

### An Extraordinary General Meeting held on 16 November 2021 resolved to distribute a dividend of SEK 2.95 per share.

### D. External auditor

### Corporate culture and policies

### Avanza’s corporate culture is based on a vision to create a better future for millions of people. The key is that what we do will create value for our customers. The corporate culture is characterised by collaboration, humility and an aim to constantly challenge ourselves to think differently. Decision-making channels are short and there is room for different opinions.

###  Avanza has a Group-wide policy on diversity and equality, which can be found at avanza.se/ir. For Avanza, diversity and equality mean utilising everyone’s knowledge, experience and views to enrich, create dynamism and influence every part of the Company. The policy also ensures that all employees are treated fairly and that there is no discrimination. The CEO has overarching responsibility for diversity and gender equality. The work is done systematically with updated documentation, analysis, active measures, evaluations and follow-ups. Equality issues are tracked through employee surveys. Parity between women and men, is measured in Group Management and among managers with personnel responsibility. Avanza’s management at the end of 2021 was comprised of 4 women and 5 men. Among managers, 46 per cent are women.

### Occupational health and safety is a priority. Healthy employees make for a better and more effective organisation and  create shareholder value. The overarching goal of our health and safety work is to create and maintain an environment where employees have the right opportunities given their position and goals. Avanza has a dedicated committee that deals with the overall structure for systematic occupational health and safety work and equality issues.

### Avanza has a high recommendation rate among employees with an eNPS score of 67.

### For more information, see pages 32–36.

### Regulatory training

### Avanza has a code of conduct that includes our ethical guidelines. The code applies to all employees and provides guidance on how we build long-term relationships by describing the responsibility that comes with being an employee. The code contains Avanza’s stance on business ethics and reporting routines as well as how we expect employees to act in ethical dilemmas.

### Acting ethically and taking measures to prevent unethical or illegal behaviour is an important part of Avanza’s culture. Employees are encouraged to report actions that could be considered unethical or illegal. Incoming reports are handled confidentially. Whistleblowers can contact either their immediate superior or the Head of Compliance, or use an external whistleblowing tool where they can remain anonymous. All reporting through the external tool is encrypted and shall ensure the anonymity of the person who filed the report. Reports can also be submitted to HR, the CEO or the Chairman of the Board. Avanza has a whistleblowing instruction adopted by the Board. A whistleblower who reports legitimate concerns about illegal or unethical behaviour have Avanza’s full support and are not at risk of losing their job or facing any form of reprisal as a result of their actions.

### All new employees are introduced to current laws, which is followed up on a regular basis to ensure that the employees are kept updated on regulations and any changes. In addition, individual departments arrange separate, in-depth training in specific areas. All employees undergo regular web-based training in GDPR, security, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption.

### As a company in the financial market, we have an obligation to help maintain trust in the market. Avanza abides by Sweden’s anti-corruption laws and practices and under no circumstances accepts active or passive bribery or other illegal payments. The Avanza Group works continuously to fight corruption and has an anti-bribery policy that complies with Swedish law. The policy and Avanza’s Code of Conduct are included in the mandatory compliance training for new employees and can be found at Avanza.se/ir. Supplemental training is provided every three years for all employees. Compliance training includes the work being done in anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, central laws and rules for the regulated operations of Group companies, and other key guidelines and policies. Neither Avanza nor any of Avanza’s employees have been convicted of bribery or other crimes related to corruption.

### Avanza’s internal regulations are easily available to all employees on the internal web. All employees of Avanza have a responsibility to understand and stay updated on the laws and internal rules that affect and are relevant to their work. Avanza is also affiliated with Swedsec, which sets proficiency requirements, issues licenses and requires compliance of those who work as specialists with mortgages and in management or control functions. All of these approximately 100 employees were Swedsec certified as of year end.

### F. Board of Directors

### The Board of Directors sets forth the business framework, appoints the CEO and exercises control over the Company’s management. The Board’s duty is to manage the Group’s affairs in the best interests of Avanza and its shareholders in order to create the best conditions for a sustainable business. The duties of the Board are governed by the Swedish Companies Act, the Code and the formal plan that the Board has established for its work.

### The Board takes decisions on matters concerning Avanza’s strategic direction, major investments, organisational issues, acquisitions and divestments. Furthermore, each Board establishes policies and guidelines, as well as the terms of reference for the CEO. Where applicable, subsidiaries establish work plans for the control functions Risk Management, Compliance, Internal Audit and the Actuarial function.

### The AGM 2021 re-elected all previously elected Board members except Birgitta Klasén, who declined re-election. Additionally, Leemon Wu was elected as a new member in accordance with the Nomination Committee’s proposal. According to the Articles of Association, the Board shall consist of no fewer than five and no more than nine members. Avanza’s Board consisted in 2021, as of the AGM, of nine members elected until the next AGM and no deputies. The Chairman of the Board is Sven Hagströmer. The Board held its first meeting following election on 30 March 2021. Information about the members of the Board can be found on Avanza’s website and on pages 54–55.

### Diversity and suitability

### The guidelines on suitability assessments set forth how Avanza evaluates appointees for their assignments, how conflicts of interest are addressed and how a suitably diverse board is achieved. The Board’s composition of individuals of varying age, with a goal of gender parity, and with varying educational and professional backgrounds will help to ensure that the Board collectively has the ability to critically review and understand relevant regulations and can identify the risks caused and faced by the Company. New members are also evaluated in terms of the number of executive and/or non-executive positions they hold, to ensure they have the time needed for the Board’s work. These assessments are made in conjunction with new appointments and followed up at least annually. Based on the suitability assessments, annual training plans are then formulated. Background checks were made of all Board members in 2021. Information on the Board’s composition, age and background is shown on pages 54–55.

### The boards of the subsidiaries Avanza Bank AB and Försäkringsaktiebolaget Avanza Pension follow their own guidelines on suitability assessments adapted to the requirements of a suitable composition and collective competence for the board of each company. Subsidiary boards consist of members with varying experience and education, which contributes to a suitable composition of competences.

### Work of the Board in 2021

### During the year, the Board held a total of 16 meetings, including 8 regular meetings, 1 inaugural meeting, 5 extra and 2 by telephone/mail. Board meetings by telephone/mail mainly addressed decisions relating to Avanza’s incentive scheme.

### At scheduled meetings, the following are always discussed:

### Q financial reporting

### Q operational reporting

### Q reporting by the Board’s committees

### Q credit reporting for the subsidiary Avanza Bank

### In addition to the recurring items on the agenda, the Board addressed the matters described in the illustration on the previous page. The Board also focused on the Group’s implementation of and alignment with new and amended regulations affecting various parts of its operations.

### The Board also worked on and participated in strategic business planning in order to continuously adapt and improve Avanza’s customer offering.

### At the end of each calendar year, an evaluation is undertaken to improve the Board’s work procedures and competence. The evaluation is conducted by the Board members evaluating their own and the Board’s collective competence as well as the Board’s work and work procedures. The results are communicated to the Nomination Committee and compiled in a report, which then forms the basis for any changes or training.

### The Board of Directors’ competence training

### Each year the Board establishes a training plan to give members a better understanding of various areas, relevant rules and risks that affect the business as well as new products and services Avanza is launching. Board members also visit various parts of Avanza on their own initiative to better familiarise themselves with specific areas. The Board’s training needs are reviewed and specific measures are taken as needed to provide information and improve competence in special areas. In 2021, the Board underwent training with a focus on insurance law, updated capital adequacy rules, fund regulations, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules, cloud services and outsourcing, as well as rules on sustainability. New Board members receive introductory training to gain an overview of the Group and its operations and an understanding of Avanza’s values and culture.

### Formal work plan of the Board of Directors The Board follows a formal work plan it adopts on an annual basis, which regulates the division of duties, decision-making, signatories, meeting procedures and the Chairman’s duties. It also covers the Board’s responsibilities and duties as well as how to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.

### The Board’s work follows a plan that meets the Board’s information needs and is otherwise governed by established procedures for dividing duties between the Board and the CEO. In addition, the Company’s auditor presents the audit and observations to the Board. The Company’s auditor attended and reported to the Board at one Board meeting as well as attended the Audit Committee’s meetings in 2021. Company employees participate in the Board’s meetings as rapporteurs and secretary.

### Remuneration for Board members and attendance  at Board meetings

###  The AGM 2021 resolved to pay annual remuneration of SEK 368,000 each to the Chairman of the Board and Board members Jonas Hagströmer and Magnus Dybeck. The fee paid to other Board members was set at SEK 460,000 each, combined with a recommendation to invest one third of the net fee in shares in Avanza. In addition, a fee of SEK 54,500 was set for members of Avanza Bank’s Credit Committee and SEK 44,000 for members of the Company’s Remuneration Committee and IT Committee. For the Risk, Capital and Audit Committee, SEK 225,000 was set for the Chairman and SEK 100,000 to each member. Board members who receive a salary through their employment with the Company are not entitled to Board fees. In 2021, no board members were employed by the company. More information in Note 9, Employees and personnel costs.

### Board work requires all members to engage and participate in issues concerning the Company’s and the Group’s organisation and management of its affairs, establishment of qualitative and quantitative operating goals, and approval of the Company’s strategy to achieve these goals. This is in addition to Avanza’s long-term financial interests, the risks Avanza and its subsidiaries are and may potentially be exposed to, and the capital required to cover these risks. The duties of the Board are delegated to the committees as described below. On issues that require specific expertise and independence, the Board discusses which of its members are the most qualified to oversee or investigate them. The Board continuously evaluates the competence needs of each committee.

### Board members have no individual areas of responsibility beyond this and the committee work specified below.

### F.1 Remuneration Committee

### The Board appoints the Remuneration Committee, which in the financial year 2021 consisted of Mattias Miksche (Chairman), Sven Hagströmer and Catharina Eklöf. The Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending remuneration principles.

### The Committee prepares proposals on remuneration for Group Management and the managements of the subsidiaries Avanza Bank AB, Avanza Fonder AB and Försäkringsaktiebolaget Avanza Pension, for the heads of the control functions Risk Management, Internal Audit, Compliance and the Actuarial function, as well as for identified risk-takers. Remuneration is approved by the board of each Group company. The Committee also prepares issues relating to the CEO’s terms of employment and benefits for approval by the Board.

### In 2021, the Committee held 7 meetings and also maintained regular contact.

### F.2 Credit Committee

### The Board of Directors of Avanza Bank AB appoints the members of the Credit Committee, which in the financial year 2021 consisted of Board members Hans Toll (Chairman), Sven Hagströmer and Johan Roos. The Committee is tasked with taking decisions on credit matters, with the exception of credits to related parties, which the entire Board takes the decision on. Minutes are kept of the Committee’s meetings and decisions, which are distributed to the Board at its next meeting.

### In 2021, the Credit Committee held 31 meetings and also maintained regular contact.

### F.3 Risk, Capital and Audit Committee

### The Board appoints the Risk, Capital and Audit Committee, which during the financial year consisted of Johan Roos (Chairman), Viktor Fritzén, Jonas Hagströmer and Hans Toll. In its capacity as risk and capital committee, the committee shall support the Board on risk and capital issues and serve as a forum for analysis and in-depth discussion of the company’s risk taking and capital requirements. In its capacity as audit committee, the committee also monitors that the financial reporting maintains high quality, receives reports from the auditor, reviews and monitors the auditor’s impartiality and independence, evaluates the auditing performance and provides input to the Nomination Committee on the AGM proposal on the auditor’s election. The committee’s members meet the independence requirements of the Swedish Companies Act and the Code, as well as accounting or auditing competence requirements.

### The auditor attended all of the Risk, Capital and Audit Committee’s regularly scheduled meetings and reported on the audit on 3 occasions in 2021. Internal Audit also participated at all of the meetings and has reported its independent observations on a quarterly basis. The quarterly reporting was also provided to the Board.

### The Risk, Capital and Audit Committee held 8 meetings in 2021 and also maintained regular contact.

### F.4 IT Committee

### The Board of Directors appoints the IT Committee, which during the financial year consisted of Magnus Dybeck (Chairman), Jonas Hagströmer and Mattias Miksche. The IT Committee is tasked with monitoring and reviewing critical projects with a high IT content, as well as preparing issues in advance of the Board’s decisions on such projects. The IT Committee held 11 meetings in 2021 and also maintained regular contact.

### G. Internal control and risk management

### The Avanza Group shall be distinguished by good internal governance, risk management and control, and operate in an ethically responsible and professional manner with clearly defined roles and areas of responsibility. The risk management processes are designed to be effective and purposeful and include an independent risk management function with responsibility for governance, monitoring and reporting on the Group’s aggregate risks. As a rule, the subsidiaries shall apply the same principles for governance, risk management and control at a company- specific level as those at the Group level. Exceptions are made for specific legal or supervisory requirements and, in terms of proportionality, for the subsidiary’s operations, scope and/or complexity, and when specific types of risk only exist in a single subsidiary.

### Three lines of defence principle

### Risk management and risk control in the Group and its subsidiaries are based on the three lines of defence principle. The first line of defence is comprised of the business operations. The second line of defence is comprised of the Risk Management function, Compliance and, for Försäkringsaktiebolaget Avanza Pension, the Actuarial function, which are independent of each other and independent of other operations. The third line of defence is comprised of Internal Audit, which reports directly to the board of each Group company.

### G.  Internal control and risk management, Three lines of defence

### 1. First line of defence – risk management in the business operations

### Risk management primarily takes place in the first line of defence, which consists of business and support functions with specific responsibility for each department. Within the Company’s regulatory framework are specific frameworks for risk management with policies, guidelines, instructions, risk appetites and limits for each type of risk.

### 2. Second line of defence

### 2.1 Risk Management function

### An important part of risk management is to promote a sustainable risk culture and risk-taking that never threatens the Company’s survival. The culture is derived from the Board’s and management’s governance and decision-making. Within the framework of the Group’s financial capacity, the Board has formulated a risk appetite, which has been further broken down in the form of CEO limits. To ensure that risk-taking stays within the risk appetite and limit structures, risk management and control processes have been put in place to identify, valuate, manage, report and monitor every type of risk that the Company, including its subsidiaries, is exposed to.

### Risk monitoring and control are performed in among other ways by limiting and measuring financial risks, self-assessments of non-financial risks, incident reporting and follow-ups, and risk analysis and approval of major changes by the Group functions. The Risk management function provides an overview of the Group’s risk exposure and limit utilisation to management on a monthly basis and to the Board on a quarterly basis. In addition the Chief Risk Officer reports directly to the CEO and the Chairman of the Board as needed. The Chief Risk Officer falls directly under the supervision of the CEO.

### 2.2 Compliance

### Compliance verifies that subsidiaries with licensing requirements follow applicable laws, regulations, internal directives and accepted practices. Compliance monitors and regularly assesses whether the measures and routines that Avanza and its subsidiaries have introduced are appropriate and effective. Compliance proposes internal rules, routines and measures that are needed to minimise the risk of non-compliance and to assist the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA) in its supervisory capacity.

### Compliance is also responsible for keeping Avanza’s employees informed and educated on the applicable rules for subsidiaries with licensing requirements.

### Compliance falls directly under the supervision of the CEO of each subsidiary and reports on a quarterly bases at Board meetings and regularly to Group Management, in addition to reporting directly to the CEO and the Chairman of the Board as needed.

### 2.3 Actuarial function

### The Actuarial function is responsible for formulating and verifying that the actuarial calculations by the subsidiary Försäkringsaktiebolaget Avanza Pension meet established limits, and to assist the Board and the CEO on matters involving methods, calculations and assessments of technical provisions and insurance risks as well as reinsurance protection and other risk reduction techniques.

### The Actuarial function, which for the main part of 2021 was outsourced to Northern Actuarial AB, is subordinate to the insurance company’s CEO. The Actuarial function regularly reports at the board meetings of Försäkringsaktiebolaget Avanza Pension. In December 2021, the outsourcing of the Actuarial function to Northern Actuarial AB was terminated when a Head of the Actuarial function was employed by Försäkringsaktiebolaget Avanza Pension.

### 3. Third line of defence – Internal Audit

### Internal Audit is an independent internal audit function appointed by and directly under the supervision of the respective board of directors within the Group. Internal Audit’s work is based on a risk-based audit plan established by each board. The plan is based on a thorough risk analysis and the audit work includes examining and assessing governance and internal control, examining and assessing whether the Company’s organisation, governance processes, IT systems, models and routines are appropriate and effective, and examining and regularly evaluating the reliability and quality of the work performed by other control functions. Internal Audit issues recommendations after each review and then regularly follows up to verify that the re commendations have been acted on.

### Internal Audit provides internal auditing services to all Group subsidiaries with licensing requirements by having the subsidiaries outsource this function to the Parent Company.

### The results of the internal audits are reported quarterly, both in writing and orally, at the Board meetings and the Audit Committee as well as to the CEO.

### Board of Directors’ report on internal control over financial reporting

### The Board is responsible, under the provisions of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551), the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and the Swedish Code of Conduct for Corporate Governance (“the Code”), for internal control for both Avanza and the entire Avanza Group. This description is limited to internal control over financial reporting and constitutes a part of the Corporate governance report, which is appended to the Company’s Annual report.

### System of internal control and risk management over financial reporting

### Internal control over financial reporting is a process, the purpose of which is to ensure compliance with the established principles for internal control and financial reporting, and that the financial reporting is prepared in accordance with laws, regulations, applicable accounting standards and generally accepted accounting principles, as well as all other requirements for companies with transferable securities listed for trade in a regulated market.

### Control environment

### The keys to Avanza’s internal control over financial reporting are the control environment described in the Corporate governance report, a clear and transparent organisational structure, the distribution of responsibilities, and governing internal documents such as policies, guidelines and instructions.

### Another component of the control environment is risk assessment, i.e. identification and management of risks that can affect financial reporting, as well as the control activities to prevent, identify and rectify errors and discrepancies.

### Risk management

### Management of risks related to the financial reporting is proactive and emphasises continuous assessments, controls and training. Avanza applies available techniques and methods in a cost-effective manner. Risk management is an integral part of the business operations. Refer to previous page for more information.

### Control activities

###  Control activities are integrated into the financial reporting process. They include both general and more detailed controls, which are designed to prevent, identify and rectify errors and discrepancies. Control activities are formulated and documented at a Company-wide and department level, based on a reasonable level of risk of errors and their impacts. Each department manager has primary responsibility for managing the risks associated with the department’s operations and financial reporting processes.

### A high level of IT security is also crucial to effective internal control over financial reporting. For this reason, rules and guidelines have been established to ensure the availability, accuracy, confidentiality and traceability of the information in the business systems.

### Information and communication

### The information and communication channels are designed to promote thoroughness and accuracy in the financial reporting. Governing documents applying to the financial reporting have been made available and known to appropriate employees through the Company’s intranet and have been supplemented with relevant routines and process descriptions.

### Continuous information, dialogue, training and controls ensure that the employees are aware of and understand the internal regulations. This ensures a high standard of financial reporting. The entire Group applies the same system for financial reporting.

### Follow-up

### Avanza’s Controller function compiles and reports financial and operating data and analyses to department managers, Group Management and the Board. Moreover, the accounting and controller departments actively monitors operating expenses in relation to budgets and forecasts. This work is undertaken in close cooperation with Group Management and managers in the organisation.

### The control functions Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit monitor compliance with policies, guidelines and instructions. Additionally, Avanza has a Reporting Committee to take responsibility for, discuss and decide on questions concerning regulatory reporting, including new reporting requirements, new and revised reporting templates, and interpretations and assumptions regarding regulations and technical instructions from authorities for the various reports.

### The Board receives monthly financial reports, and the financial situation is addressed at every Board meeting. The Board receives quarterly reports from the control functions Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit. All of these reports are based on an evaluation of the Group’s activities and cover the entire organisation.

### The Board also reviews the quarterly financial reports and annual accounts, as well as the observations and conclusions of the external and internal auditors.

### The Group’s information and communication channels are monitored on a regular basis to ensure they are appropriate for the financial reporting.

### Assessment and position on internal audits Internal Audit’s work is based on an audit plan established annually by the Board of each subsidiary. The plan is based on a risk analysis and the work comprises an examination and assessment of whether systems, internal control mechanisms and routines are appropriate and effective. Internal Audit also issues recommendations, controlls that these recommendations are followed and reports in writing at least once a year to the Board of Directors and the CEO.

### The Chairman of the Board of each subsidiary and the Chairman of the Risk, Capital and Audit Committee in Avanza Bank discuss with the internal auditors which issues and areas to review.

### Avanza’s Annual report is available on avanza.se/ir.

### Group structure

### Avanza Bank Holding AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the Avanza Group. The operational activities are conducted by the wholly-owned subsidiaries Avanza Bank AB (publ), Försäkringsaktiebolaget Avanza Pension (“Avanza Pension”) and Avanza Fonder AB, the operations of which are supervised by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA). Placera Media Stockholm AB is also included in the Group, a media company that publishes topical news and independent advice on the financial website Placera and the financial magazine Börsveckan. The subsidiary Avanza Förvaltning AB is responsible for holding of all warrants, which are acquired to be sold to the personnel under the terms of the established warrant programmes. Avanza owns 19.8 per cent of the mortgage lender Stabelo Group AB.

### Description of the operations

### Avanza is Sweden’s leading platform for savings and investments. Avanza offers a broad range of savings products, a strong occupational pension offering and mortgages. Avanza challenges established structures of large banks and pension providers and drives the long-term development of financial products and services. Customers are offered to save in Swedish and foreign securities and in savings accounts, with no fixed account charges and at a very low brokerage fee. Avanza primarily targets individual investors, but also offers services for professional investors and corporate customers, such as entrepreneurs, asset managers and those who want occupational pension.

### Market and sales

### The Swedish savings market amounted to just over SEK 11,200 billion as of 30 September 2021, an increase by just over 13 per cent since the end of 2020. The occupational pension market increased by nearly 11 per cent to SEK 3,960 billion. 1) In the same period, Avanza’s savings capital increased by 29 per cent and the occupational pension capital with 25 per cent.

### Avanza’s share of the Swedish savings market increased in terms of savings capital to 6.6 per cent, while the market share

### Pension and insurance savings, i.e. the life insurance market, is the single largest savings segment, accounting for just less than half of the Swedish market. The occupational pension market can be divided into traditional life and unit-linked insurance. Unit-linked insurance accounts for close to 40 per cent, of which Avanza is active in the portion outside collectively agreed occupational pensions. Statistics from Insurance Sweden show that Avanza’s market share regarding non collectively agreed unitlinked insurance per the end of 2020 was 3.8 (3.3) per cent 3) .

### Avanza’s market shares for the last 12-month period for premium payments to non collectively agreed occupational pensions increased to 7.7 per cent. With respect to premium inflows to the competitive pension and life insurance market, including endowment insurance, Avanza was the leader with a market share of inflows of 12.3 per cent. 1)

### As of 30 September 2021, the Swedish mortgage market regarding households was valued at just under SEK 3,820 billion. Avanza has since 2013 offered internally financed mortgages on a small scale to Private Banking customers. Since 2018, Avanza is a distributor of external mortgages, which are offered to a broader customer group. Avanza’s share of the Swedish mortgage market, including external mortgages, was 0.7 (0.6) per cent. The market share of the net change was 2.9 (2.5) per cent on an annual basis 2) .

### The majority of stock exchanges around the world performed strongly in 2021. Volatility decreased compared to 2020, but remained at high levels and the OMX Stockholm Gross Index rose by 39 per cent. The number of transactions on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and First North increased by 15 per cent and turnover increased by 10 per cent compared to the previous year. Among Avanza’s customers, the number of transactions on theses markets increased by 27 per cent while the turnover was up by 16 per cent. Avanza’s market shares increased during the year and Avanza was the largest Swedish player in terms of both transactions and turnover.

### The number of customers rose in 2021 by 379,800 and the total number of customers amounted to 1,660,100 at the end of the year. Within occupational pension the number of customers rose by 18 per cent to 127,200.

### Savings capital increased in 2021 driven by the positive stock market development but also net inflow. The net inflow was SEK

### 89.8 billion, an increase of 18 per cent compared to previous year and the highest annual inflow in Avanza’s history. At the end of the year, savings capital amounted to nearly SEK 810 billion, an increase of 42 per cent in 2021.

### Information related to Covid-19

### Avanza’s operations have after the outbreak of Covid-19 continued without major disruptions. The pandemic, together with various political measures and stimulus from central banks have increased access to capital and made the stock market more attractive. Since the beginning of 2020, customers have been more active in their savings, and the trading activity among Avanza’s customers have been at historically high levels. Customer growth and the net inflow have been strong as well.

### The aftermath of the pandemic is hard to predict. At the end of September, most of the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in Sweden only to be partially reintroduced in mid-December. In the short period when the restrictions were eliminated, there were no appreciable changes in customer growth, net inflow or customer activity. A return to a more normal life after the pandemic could affect the net inflow by reducing the savings ratio. Customer activity is more closely tied to market conditions and volatility, and it is not unusual for activity to slow after major turbulence. However, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of savings and having a buffer. This, together with a 70 per cent increase in the number of customers since the end of 2019, makes us confident that Avanza has raised its lowest level. Due to the strong growth since January 2020, when the 2025 targets were set, the long-term targets have been updated and are presented on pages 22–25. Avanza’s long-term strategies remain unchanged. Neither strengthened provisions nor actual credit losses connected to the pandemic were recognised during 2020 nor 2021.

### Seasonal effects

### Avanza has no major seasonal variations, except from the third quarter which is characterised by lower personnel costs, due to employees’ summer vacation, and also seasonally low Corporate Finance activity. Avanza’s financial results are rather impacted by cyclical market factors such as stock market development, volatility and the repo rate. Customer growth and net inflow are normally higher at the beginning of the year.

### Product and business development

### Avanza’s offer is continuously updated and developed with new functions and improvements. During the year, the Swedish equity index-tracking fund Avanza Sverige, which offers exposure to the entire Swedish market at a low fee, was launched.

### The fund’s management fee is 0.15 per cent.

### The Avanza Auto funds, which give customers access to automatically managed fund portfolios based on a chosen savings horizon and desired risk level, received an update. The management model has been reassessed and the management fee was reduced from 0.35 to 0.20 per cent.

### To help more people start saving, Avanza has since 2016 a Start offer with commission-free equity trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The Start offer is available to customers with less than SEK 50,000 in savings capital. This year, Start was expanded to also include funds. This means that customers are refunded all fund fees, including any exchange fees. All 1,350 funds on the platform are included.

### The “Right Now” page launched in the apps, which provides a simple way to track savings on a daily basis. It also makes it easy to find pages and functions that the customer often uses or views and is designed to make it easier to stay updated on savings and receive valuable insight.

###  Monthly saving has also been simplified through new flows and opportunities to schedule automatic fund purchases. Milestones and Savings targets were launched in the apps. Milestones show when new savings levels have been reached and are designed to motivate and engage. Savings targets are a tool where customers set up visual and concrete goals. Customers can also create a savings plan. Savings can then be tracked in a graph, and it is easy to simulate various future scenarios.

### A sought-after Stop Loss function was launched in the apps to buy or sell a share at the predetermined price. The function was expanded at the same time to include U.S. equities. The pages in the apps for ETF’s, indexes, warrants and bonds were updated with a new design and new functions as well, which enables technical analysis and comparisons of instruments.

### The stock pages were updated with a new, easier ordering process, and the transaction pages were given a better overview of current orders and historical transactions. The technical analysis function was improved to make it easier to predict future price performance. New investment themes were launched in Avanza Trackers, including renewable energy, the digital economy, innovative technology and smart cities. The range of publicly traded products was expanded with new ETF’s.

### In occupational pensions, a new landing page, new product page and new customer flow for companies were introduced. This makes it possible to sign up for an occupational pension insurance directly in the app, regardless of the number of employees.

### Moreover, margin lending was expanded with more eligible securities. In addition, the interest rate for lending on funds was reduced. The benefit levels for margin lending were eliminated as well, which means the same low interest rate for everyone.

### The mortgage offer was expanded through a partnership with Landshypotek. Avanza thereby became the first in Sweden to offer customers the option to apply for, track and manage mortgages from different lenders on the same platform. The partnership broadens the offer with competitive interest rates, at the same time that demand for mortgages for higher loan to value ratios, new homes and second homes is met.

### A large part of the development work during the year was devoted to the replacement of Avanza’s backoffice system. The new system will enable us to use smarter technology and solutions to increase efficiency at the same time that scalability and opportunities for product development are improved. Read more on pages 28–30.

### Results

### Operating profit increased by 55 per cent compared to 2020. Operating income increased as well as operating expenses. The operating margin increased to 74 per cent and the return on shareholder’s equity was 50 per cent.

### Operating income increased by 41 per cent compared to 2020. This was primarily a result of higher net brokerage income and currency-related income, as well as higher net fund commissions. Other income and net interest income also increased.

### Net brokerage income increased by 32 per cent, a result of more brokerage-generating customers, even though the number of brokerage-generating notes per brokerage-generating customer decreased slightly. The number of brokerage-generating customers was 32 per cent higher than at the end of 2020 and the number of commission-generating notes was 44 per cent higher in 2021. Turnover in brokerage-generating securities increased by 29 per cent. Gross brokerage income per SEK of turnover increased at the same time from 11.1 to 11.4 basis points. This was due to a higher share of brokerage income
